"""Tests for the engine-owned MCPManager pool backing `type: mcp` steps.

Covers:
- Lazy connect happens once and the manager is reused for repeated calls
- connect_server raising propagates, leaves no half-open manager in the pool,
  and the next call re-attempts the connect
- Two servers connect concurrently (the pool guard never spans I/O)
- run()/resume() finally blocks close all pooled managers and clear the pool
- The per-server slot lock is a stable object per server name and distinct
  across server names

All MCP interaction is mocked — no real MCP servers are spawned.
