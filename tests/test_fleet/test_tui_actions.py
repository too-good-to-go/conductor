"""Pilot tests for the Fleet Manager TUI's shared actions (Fleet Manager E8).

Uses Textual's ``App.run_test()`` to drive a real (headless) instance of
:class:`~conductor.fleet.tui.app.FleetApp` against seeded run records,
covering E8-T4:

- ``w`` on a portless run is disabled with a visible reason.
- ``w`` on a ``--web``/``--web-bg`` run invokes the browser opener with the
  right URL.
- ``k`` signals exactly the selected PID and does not report success until
  the process is confirmed gone (E3-T10's verify-then-report contract).
- ``K`` prompts exactly once and signals every displayed run.
- Declining the confirmation modal signals nothing.
- A kill on an already-dead PID does not raise.
- The TUI and CLI resolve to the same shared implementation
  (``conductor.cli.app.stop_records``).

    so its width fell back to Textual's base `1fr` -- and an `auto`-width
    container whose children are all `1fr` resolves to 0. Both children
    collapsed to 0x0 and the dialog painted as nothing but its own
    `border: thick $error` -- an empty red box.

    These assert against painted geometry and composited text (the
    convention established in ``test_tui_runs.py`` and
    ``test_tui_run_detail.py``), not just the string handed to
    ``ConfirmKillModal.__init__`` -- which is what let a completely
    invisible dialog pass the rest of this suite for as long as it did.
    Five of the seven tests below are rendering regressions in that sense;
    the remaining two (``test_confirm_still_works_while_the_scroll_holds_focus``,
    ``test_cancel_still_works_while_the_scroll_holds_focus``) are forward
    guards on the newly-focusable scroll container rather than #449
