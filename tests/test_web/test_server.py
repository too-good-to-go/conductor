"""Tests for the WebDashboard server.

Tests cover:
- GET /api/state returns empty list initially, accumulates events
- WebSocket endpoint: connect, receive broadcast event, verify JSON structure
- Late-joiner: emit events, then connect client, verify /api/state returns all
- Auto-shutdown: workflow_completed + disconnect → wait_for_clients_disconnect resolves
- Broadcast error isolation: failed send doesn't crash broadcaster
