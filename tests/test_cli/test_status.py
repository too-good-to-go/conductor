"""Tests for the read-only ``conductor status`` command (issue #384).

Before this command existed, the only way to see which background workflows
were running was ``conductor stop`` — which stops one when exactly one is
running. So the natural "what's running?" reflex was destructive precisely when
there was a single run to lose. I killed a healthy 40-minute workflow that way.

The property under test is therefore simple and absolute: **`status` must never
terminate anything, in any configuration.**

It also surfaces the dashboard URL, which is otherwise unrecoverable once the
launching terminal is gone.

As of the MCP server plan's E4, this command also lists recently-completed
runs (from ``read_terminal_records``) in a second section below the live
one — a user-facing contract change accepted at stakeholder review (R1),
since ``status``/``fleet list`` previously meant "runs alive right now."
``--live`` restores the pre-E4 scope exactly, and the underlying "never
terminates, never prunes" property above is unaffected by any of it.
