## When to Use Copilot

### ✅ Choose Copilot if:

1. **You have a GitHub Copilot subscription** — Already paying $10-39/month, no additional API costs
2. **You need MCP tool support** — Web search, code execution, file operations, external API integrations
3. **You want streaming responses** — Real-time feedback, better UX for long-running workflows
4. **You prefer enterprise support** — GitHub Enterprise integration, SSO, access controls
5. **Heavy usage** — Flat rate beats pay-per-token at scale

### When to Use Copilot

1. **You have a GitHub Copilot subscription** — No additional costs, predictable billing
2. **You need MCP tool support** — Web search, code execution, file operations
3. **You want streaming responses** — Real-time feedback as the model generates
4. **Heavy usage** — Flat rate beats pay-per-token at scale
5. **Enterprise features** — SSO, GitHub Enterprise integration

### Example Copilot Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  name: copilot-workflow
  runtime:
    provider: copilot
    default_model: gpt-5.2
    mcp_servers:
      web-search:
        command: npx
        args: ["-y", "open-websearch@latest"]
        tools: ["*"]

agents:
  - name: researcher
    tools: [web_search]
    prompt: "Research {{ topic }} using web search"
```

## When to Use OpenAI

### ✅ Choose OpenAI if:

1. **You work primarily with OpenAI models or custom endpoints** — GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, o1, o3-mini, or compatible proxies (OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM)
2. **You need full temperature control** — OpenAI supports temperatures from 0.0 up to 2.0
3. **You want pay-per-token usage with native schema enforcement** — Built on Pydantic AI's forced tool call structured output
4. **You use custom gateways** — Point `base_url` to local or corporate OpenAI-compatible endpoints

### Example OpenAI Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  name: openai-workflow
  runtime:
    provider: openai
    default_model: gpt-5-mini
    temperature: 0.7

agents:
  - name: analyzer
    prompt: "Analyze the following text: {{ workflow.input.text }}"
```

## When to Use Claude

### ✅ Choose Claude if:

1. **You need a large context window** — 200K tokens, all models; great for long documents and multi-agent workflows
2. **You want fine-grained cost control** — Pay only for what you use; scale to zero when idle
3. **You value reasoning quality** — Claude excels at analysis, synthesis, and following complex instructions
4. **Light/intermittent usage** — Pay-per-use is cheaper than a subscription at low volumes
5. **You need reliable structured output** — Native schema enforcement more robust than prompt injection

### Example Claude Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  name: claude-workflow
  runtime:
    provider: claude
    default_model: claude-sonnet-4.5
    max_tokens: 4096
    temperature: 0.7

agents:
  - name: analyzer
    prompt: "Analyze the following document ({{ document | length }} chars)"
```

## When to Use Claude Agent SDK

### ✅ Choose Claude Agent SDK if:

1. **You want built-in tool support with Claude models**
   - WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash, file operations out of the box
   - No MCP server configuration needed for common tools
   - Full Claude Code toolset available

2. **You already use the `claude` CLI**
   - Authentication handled by the CLI
   - No separate API key management
   - Settings inherited from your Claude Code environment

3. **You want the SDK to manage the agentic loop**
   - Tool execution and structured output handled by the SDK / CLI
   - Less provider code to maintain
   - Native interrupt support
   - **Note:** the SDK does *not* retry transient API errors internally — Conductor classifies SDK errors and surfaces them so workflow-level `retry:` drives recovery.

4. **You need streaming with Claude models**
   - Real-time message streaming (unlike the raw Claude provider)
   - Typed message objects for each event

### Important: Tools and MCP Servers

The `claude-agent-sdk` provider bridges MCP servers into the CLI, but not per-agent tool allowlists. Concretely:

- `runtime.mcp_servers` — **supported**. Servers are translated into the SDK's MCP config and attach alongside the built-in preset. Only declared servers attach: Conductor sets `strict_mcp_config`, so ambient Claude Code MCP settings are ignored. A narrowing per-server `tools:` filter is refused, since the SDK has no equivalent field.
- Per-agent `tools: []` — disables the built-in tools for that agent, except the `Skill` loader when the agent has skills enabled (an empty tool set would otherwise leave a declared skill unreachable). Declared MCP servers still attach, so this combination is rejected at `conductor validate` when the workflow declares `mcp_servers`.
- Per-agent `tools: [list]` — **refused loudly**. Workflow tool names do not translate to Claude CLI tool IDs; silently passing them through would risk granting the wrong native tool.
- Workflow-level `tools:` combined with an agent that omits `tools:` — **rejected at `conductor validate`**. The agent would otherwise inherit that non-empty list at runtime and hit the same refusal with a confusing message. Remove the workflow-level `tools:` (so omitting `tools:` grants the preset) or set the agent's `tools: []`.
- Omitting `tools:` entirely (with no workflow-level `tools:`) — grants the full `claude_code` preset (filesystem, bash, web), matching the bare `claude` CLI experience.

### Important: Skills and ambient settings

Skills are loaded natively: the Claude Code plugin that ships a declared skill is
registered on the session and the skill enabled by its `<plugin>:<skill>` name, so
the CLI reads only the `SKILL.md` frontmatter up front and the body on demand.

Conductor also sends the SDK's `setting_sources` as an empty list by default — the
skills counterpart to `strict_mcp_config`. Without it the `claude` CLI enables skills
the workflow never declared, varying by machine and launch directory, which made
`skills: []` a no-op on this provider.

That isolation is broader than skills. By default, agents on this provider do **not**
pick up:

- ambient skills from `~/.claude/skills/` or any `.claude/skills/` directory
- `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/*.md`
- user, project, and local `settings.json` (including `env` and `apiKeyHelper`)
- hooks

A workflow can opt back in per tier with `runtime.provider.setting_sources`:

```yaml
runtime:
  provider:
    name: claude-agent-sdk
    setting_sources: [project]   # user | project | local
```

The case it exists for is an agent whose `working_dir` is a *target* repository that
ships its own `.claude/skills` — the CLI has `--plugin-dir` but no `--skill-dir`, so
otherwise that repo has to package its skills as a Claude Code plugin to be reachable.
`[project]` reads them, and the repo's `CLAUDE.md` / `.claude/rules` with them.

An enabled tier brings **everything that tier defines, hooks included** — `project`
reads `<working_dir>/.claude/settings.json`, whose `hooks` run shell commands on tool
events. Enable it only for repositories trusted as much as the workflow itself.
`user` additionally reads `~/.claude/settings.json`, which makes a run depend on the
operator's machine; prefer `[project]`. The field is workflow-global while
`working_dir` is per agent, so every agent on the provider loads the tiers against
its own directory (agents without a `working_dir` against the launch directory) —
give any agent that must stay hermetic an explicit `skills: []`, which opts it out of
the tiers entirely.

Instruction files have a replacement: run with `--workspace-instructions` (or
`--instructions <file>`) to inject `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` explicitly. Settings and
hooks have none — if you rely on `apiKeyHelper` for credentials, supply them through
the environment instead.

Note the SDK treats the enabled-skill list as a context filter rather than a sandbox:
undeclared skills are hidden from the model's listing and rejected by the `Skill`
tool, but their files remain readable on disk through `Read`/`Bash`.

Because the SDK exposes **no bare skill-directory option** — a skill is enabled by
name through the plugin that ships it — a skill directory that is not inside a
Claude Code plugin cannot be loaded here at all. `conductor validate` reports such
a `skills:` entry before the run starts, naming the directory and both remedies:
package it as a plugin (a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with the skill under
`<plugin>/skills/`), or run that agent on `copilot`, which registers skill
directories directly and accepts the identical skill untouched. See the
[Skills section of the workflow syntax guide](../workflow-syntax.md#skills).

Separately, `temperature` and `max_tokens` are **rejected at the factory** —
sampling behavior is controlled by the CLI.

### Example Claude Agent SDK Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  name: sdk-workflow
  runtime:
    provider: claude-agent-sdk
    default_model: claude-sonnet-4-6

agents:
  - name: researcher
    prompt: "Research {{ topic }} using web search"
```

## When to Use Hermes

> **Experimental Provider** — Hermes is an experimental provider. See
> [Experimental Providers](./experimental.md) for stability policy and
> known limitations.

### ✅ Choose Hermes if:

1. **You want access to many model providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI, and any OpenRouter-supported model via a single provider
2. **You need hermes's built-in tool ecosystem** — Hermes manages its own tools internally; no MCP config required
3. **You're already using hermes-agent** — Integrate your existing hermes workflows with Conductor's orchestration
4. **Model flexibility matters most** — Switch between `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` and `openai/gpt-4o` by changing a single field

### ✅ Avoid Hermes if:

- You need **MCP server support** — use Copilot or Claude instead
- You need **reliable structured output** — Hermes uses prompt injection; Claude/Copilot use native APIs
- You need **reasoning effort control** — the `reasoning.effort` field is a no-op for Hermes

### Example Hermes Workflow

```yaml
workflow:
  name: hermes-workflow
  runtime:
    provider: hermes
    default_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
    max_agent_iterations: 25

agents:
  - name: researcher
    prompt: "Research the following topic thoroughly: {{ workflow.input.topic }}"
    output:
      findings:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: $end
```


## Multi-Provider Strategy

You can use both providers in different workflows:

### Use Case Segregation

```bash
# Heavy-use, tool-enabled workflows → Copilot
conductor run research-workflow.yaml --provider copilot

# Long-document analysis → Claude
conductor run document-analysis.yaml --provider claude

# High-volume simple tasks → Claude Haiku
conductor run classification.yaml --provider claude
```

### Cost Optimization

1. **Copilot**: Production workflows with tools (flat rate)
2. **Claude Haiku**: High-volume batch processing (cheap)
3. **Claude Opus**: Complex one-off analyses (premium quality)

### Redundancy/Fallback

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: copilot  # Primary
    # If Copilot fails, manually retry with Claude
```

## Summary

**Choose Copilot** for:
- ✅ MCP tool support (web search, code execution)
- ✅ Streaming responses
- ✅ Predictable costs (subscription)
- ✅ Heavy usage
- ✅ Enterprise features

**Choose Claude** for:
- ✅ Large context (200K tokens)
- ✅ Pay-per-use pricing
- ✅ Light/intermittent usage
- ✅ Long document processing
- ✅ Reliable structured output
- ✅ Cost optimization (Haiku)

**Choose Claude Agent SDK** for:
- ✅ Built-in tools (WebSearch, Bash, etc.)
- ✅ Streaming with Claude models
- ✅ SDK-managed agentic loop
- ✅ Existing `claude` CLI users
- ✅ No API key management

**Choose Hermes** for:
- ✅ Multi-provider model access (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- ✅ Hermes's built-in tool ecosystem (no MCP config)
- ✅ Existing hermes-agent workflows
- ✅ Maximum model flexibility

**Bottom line**: All four providers are excellent at what they do. Choose based on your usage patterns, budget, tool requirements, and model preferences. Conductor makes it easy to switch between them or use multiple strategically within a single multi-provider workflow.
