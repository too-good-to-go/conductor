# Conductor

A CLI tool for defining and running multi-agent workflows with the GitHub Copilot SDK and Anthropic Claude.

[![CI](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Why Conductor?

Conductor makes multi-agent workflows — code review pipelines, research-then-synthesize flows, plan-then-implement loops — **repeatable, deterministic, and version-controlled**. You define your agents, their prompts, and the routing between them in a single YAML file:

- **Repeatable** — Same inputs follow the same path through the same agents.
- **Deterministic** — Routing uses Jinja2 templates and expression evaluation. First matching condition wins. No LLM in the orchestration loop, no tokens spent deciding what runs next.
- **Source-controlled** — Plain YAML files. Diff workflows in pull requests, version them with your code, run them the same way locally and in CI.

## Features

- **YAML-based workflows** - Define multi-agent workflows in readable YAML
- **Multiple providers** - GitHub Copilot, Anthropic Claude, Claude Agent SDK (experimental), NousResearch Hermes (experimental), or Azure Container Apps sandboxed execution (experimental) with seamless switching
- **Parallel execution** - Run agents concurrently (static groups or dynamic for-each)
- **Sub-workflow composition** - Reusable sub-workflows with templated `input_mapping`, usable inside `for_each` groups for dynamic fan-out
- **Script steps** - Run shell commands and route on exit code or parsed JSON stdout
- **Set steps** - Bind one or more Jinja2-evaluated values into the context (no LLM, no subprocess) for derived flags, computed defaults, and constants reused by many later prompts
- **Terminate steps** - Explicit terminal step with `status` (`success`/`failed`) and structured `reason` — distinguishable from the default `$end` path in CLI exit codes, dashboard state, and event logs
- **Dialog mode** - Agents can pause for multi-turn conversation when uncertain
- **Reasoning effort** - Unified `reasoning.effort` (low/medium/high/xhigh/max) per agent or workflow-wide, translated to each provider's native API
- **Workspace instructions** - Auto-discover and inject `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into every agent's prompt
- **Conditional routing** - Route between agents based on output conditions
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Pause for human decisions with Markdown-rendered prompts and clickable file links
- **Safety limits** - Max iterations and timeout enforcement
- **[Web dashboard](#web-dashboard)** - Real-time workflow visualization with interactive DAG graph, breadcrumb navigation into sub-workflows, live streaming, and in-browser human gates
- **[Fleet Manager](#fleet-manager-tui)** - An interactive TUI over every running `conductor` process (foreground, `--web`, or `--web-bg`): live status, tokens and cost, gate alerts you can answer, step-level drill-down, and launching new runs — plus non-interactive `conductor stop` / `conductor fleet list`
- **Validation** - Catches stale template references, missing inputs, and undeclared dependencies before runtime


## Prerequisites

Python 3.12+ is the only hard requirement. Everything below runs out of the
clone — nothing is installed onto your `PATH`.

There are two ways to build the environment. [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
is faster and resolves from the committed `uv.lock`; the `venv` + `pip` path
needs no third-party tooling at all. Pick either.

**With uv** — install it once:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -sSfL https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

uv can supply the interpreter too, so a matching system Python is optional:

```bash
uv python install 3.12
```

**Without uv** — `venv` and `pip` both ship with Python, so there is nothing
to install first. See [Using venv and pip](#using-venv-and-pip) below.

## Running from a Clone

To run Conductor straight from a checkout, use `uv run` from the repo root.
It builds the working tree into a local `.venv` and runs your code from
there, so nothing needs to be installed onto your system first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git
cd conductor
uv run conductor run examples/simple-qa.yaml
```

Every command works this way — prefix it with `uv run`:

```bash
uv run conductor validate examples/simple-qa.yaml
uv run conductor run my-workflow.yaml --input question="What is Python?"
uv run conductor fleet list
```

The install is editable, so edits under `src/` take effect on the next run
with no reinstall step. The first `uv run` resolves and installs dependencies;
later runs reuse the existing `.venv`.

`make run` wraps the same thing when you prefer the Makefile:

```bash
make run WORKFLOW=examples/simple-qa.yaml ARGS='--input question="What is Python?"'
```

**Running against workflows in another directory.** `uv run` needs to know
which project to build, so use `--project` and Conductor will still resolve
workflow paths relative to your current directory:

```bash
uv run --project /path/to/conductor conductor run ./my-workflow.yaml
```

If you do that often, alias it:

```bash
alias conductor-dev='uv run --project /path/to/conductor conductor'
```

Then `conductor-dev run ./my-workflow.yaml` runs your clone's code from
anywhere, while still building from the checkout on every invocation.

## Using venv and pip

If you would rather not install uv, the standard library covers it. `venv`
ships with Python and creates the environment with `pip` already inside, so
this path needs no third-party tooling:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git
cd conductor
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e .
```

Then call the entrypoint out of the venv:

```bash
.venv/bin/conductor run examples/simple-qa.yaml
.venv/bin/conductor validate examples/simple-qa.yaml
```

Or activate the venv once and drop the prefix:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
conductor run examples/simple-qa.yaml
```

`-e` makes it an editable install, so edits under `src/` apply on the next
run, exactly as with `uv run`. The trade-off is that pip resolves
dependencies fresh rather than from the committed `uv.lock`, so you may get
newer versions than CI pins. Optional extras work the same way —
`.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[tui]'`.

## Network and proxy setup

### Installing behind a proxy or private package index

Conductor's dependencies are resolved from the public Python package index
(`pypi.org` / `files.pythonhosted.org`). Some networks — corporate or otherwise
managed devices in particular — block direct access to public package
registries and require every package to come from an internal mirror or proxy.

Conductor ships **no default mirror** and never redirects your packages on its
own. Point your package manager at whichever index your organization provides
and the normal install commands work unchanged.

**uv** (used by the install scripts, `uv tool install`, and `conductor update`):

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX="internal=https://<your-index-host>/simple/"
curl -sSfL https://aka.ms/conductor/install.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows -- for this shell only
$env:UV_DEFAULT_INDEX = "internal=https://<your-index-host>/simple/"
irm https://aka.ms/conductor/install.ps1 | iex

# Windows -- persist for future shells (then open a new terminal)
setx UV_DEFAULT_INDEX "internal=https://<your-index-host>/simple/"
```

The `internal=` prefix names the index. The name is optional for a plain
public mirror, but it is what credential environment variables key off — so
naming it up front saves reconfiguring later.

Persist the setting in your shell profile (or with `setx`) so later upgrades
and `conductor update --apply` inherit it. uv also reads a config file if you
prefer that to an environment variable — `~/.config/uv/uv.toml` on macOS/Linux,
`%APPDATA%\uv\uv.toml` on Windows:

```toml
[[index]]
name = "internal"
url = "https://<your-index-host>/simple/"
default = true
```

**pipx / pip** (only if you install via the `pipx` or `pip` sections above):

```bash
pip config set global.index-url https://<your-index-host>/simple/
```

> **uv does not read pip's configuration.** Setting `pip config set
> global.index-url` alone has no effect on the install scripts, `uv tool
> install`, or `conductor update` — those need `UV_DEFAULT_INDEX` (or
> `uv.toml`). Configure both if you use both toolchains.

If the index requires credentials, uv accepts them inline in the URL or via
`UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_USERNAME` / `UV_INDEX_INTERNAL_PASSWORD` — where `INTERNAL`
is the index name from the `internal=` prefix (or the `name` key) above,
upper-cased. See
[uv's index documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/indexes/#providing-credentials-directly).

When an install fails because the index is unreachable, the install scripts say
so explicitly and skip their retry backoff — retrying cannot fix a blocked
index. Two related cases are reported separately rather than being blamed on
the index:

- **A blocked `github.com`.** The installer fetches Conductor itself from git,
  and uv words that failure the same way it words an index failure. No index
  setting fixes it, so the scripts say so and point at github.com instead.
- **A transient connection blip.** These still get the full retry schedule,
  since unlike a policy block they can genuinely heal.

If the error mentions a certificate, your network is inspecting TLS — trust
your organization's root CA via `SSL_CERT_FILE`, or set `UV_NATIVE_TLS=1` to
use the system trust store. If it mentions a proxy (`407`), set `HTTPS_PROXY` /
`NO_PROXY` as well as the index URL. Do not work around the block by disabling
security tooling; ask your IT or platform team for the approved index endpoint.

## Use the Conductor skill in Claude Code or Copilot CLI

This repo doubles as a single-plugin marketplace that ships the `conductor`
skill from `plugins/conductor/skills/conductor/`. The skill teaches the
assistant the workflow YAML schema, CLI commands, and execution model.

**Claude Code:**

```text
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/conductor
/plugin install conductor@conductor
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI** (`gh skill` requires GitHub CLI 2.91+, public preview):

```bash
gh skill install microsoft/conductor conductor
```

The plugin ships only markdown — no executables, hooks, or MCP servers — so
trust verification is straightforward.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a workflow file

```yaml
# my-workflow.yaml
workflow:
  name: simple-qa
  description: A simple question-answering workflow
  entry_point: answerer

agents:
  - name: answerer
    model: gpt-5.5
    prompt: |
      Answer the following question:
      {{ workflow.input.question }}
    output:
      answer:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: $end

output:
  answer: "{{ answerer.output.answer }}"
```

### 2. Run the workflow

```bash
conductor run my-workflow.yaml --input question="What is Python?"
```

### 3. View the output

```json
{
  "answer": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language..."
}
```

## Web Dashboard

Conductor includes a built-in real-time web dashboard that lets you visualize and interact with your workflows as they run. Launch it with `--web`:

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --web --input question="What is Python?"
```

![Web Dashboard](docs/img/web-dashboard.png)

**Key features:**

- **Interactive DAG graph** — Zoomable, draggable workflow graph with animated edges showing execution flow and conditional routing
- **Live agent streaming** — Watch agent reasoning, tool calls, and outputs stream in real-time as each step executes
- **Three-pane layout** — Resizable panels for the graph, agent detail, and a tabbed output pane (Log, Activity, Output)
- **In-browser human gates** — Respond to human-in-the-loop decision points directly in the dashboard, no terminal needed
- **Per-node detail** — Click any node to see its prompt, metadata (model, tokens, cost), activity stream, and output
- **Mid-run guidance** — Send a correction to a running workflow — via the dashboard's **Guide** button or `conductor guide --text "..."` — without stopping it first. Works with both `--web` and `--web-bg`.
- **Background mode** — Run with `--web-bg` to start the dashboard in the background, print the URL, and exit. Use `conductor stop` to shut it down later and `conductor status` to list what's running.

```bash
# Run in background — prints dashboard URL and exits
conductor run workflow.yaml --web-bg --input topic="AI in healthcare"

# Send mid-run guidance to a running background workflow
conductor guide --text "Prefer Python 3.12 examples"

# Stop a background workflow
conductor stop
```

## Fleet Manager (TUI)

The dashboard shows you one run in depth. The **Fleet Manager** shows you *every* run at once — and it's where you go when something needs you. Launch it with `conductor fleet`:

```bash
# One-time: the TUI ships as an optional extra.
curl -sSfL https://aka.ms/conductor/install.sh | sh -s -- --extras tui
conductor fleet
```

> The install command depends on how you installed Conductor. Running `conductor fleet`
> without the extra prints the one that works on your machine — pinned to the version
> you are running and carrying any extras you already have, because `uv tool install
> --force` replaces the tool's whole requirement set. `conductor update` carries them
> forward for the same reason.

![Fleet Manager](docs/img/fleet-manager.png)

> **TUI = breadth. Dashboard = depth.**
>
> The TUI answers *"what's happening across my fleet, and what needs me?"* The dashboard answers *"what exactly is this one run doing?"* They compose — press `w` on any run to open its dashboard in a browser.

**Key features:**

- **Every run is discoverable** — Foreground, `--web`, and `--web-bg` runs all appear. Previously only `--web-bg` runs were visible to `conductor stop`; a plain `conductor run` had to be hunted down and killed by hand.
- **Live fleet table** — Each run's status, current step, elapsed time, tokens, cost, and a token-burn sparkline, polled continuously and sorted by recency
- **Gates that find you** — A run blocked on a human gate is badged in the table and fires a terminal bell, so a waiting workflow doesn't sit unnoticed. Press `g` to answer it without leaving the TUI.
- **Drill down** — `enter` opens a run's per-agent breakdown, then `enter` again on any step shows what it actually did: its input, output, and activity stream
- **Launch new runs** — `n` builds a form from a workflow's declared `input:` block and starts it in the background, so the TUI both watches and starts work
- **Browse and re-run** — Providers and model diagnostics (`p`), registries and their workflows (`r`), and History (`h`) for finished runs, which hands off to `conductor replay`
- **Kill safely** — `k` stops the selected run, `K` the whole fleet. Both confirm first, and a foreground run is named explicitly, since stopping one discards in-flight progress unless periodic checkpoints are enabled.

```bash
# Not interactive? These need no extra dependency:
conductor fleet list           # table of every live run
conductor stop                 # stop the only running workflow, or list them
conductor fleet prune          # bound the event logs in $TMPDIR/conductor
```

See [docs/fleet.md](docs/fleet.md) for every screen, key binding, the status vocabulary, and retention settings.

## Providers

Conductor supports multiple AI providers. Choose based on your needs:

| Feature | Copilot | Claude | Claude Agent SDK | Hermes | ACA |
|---------|---------|--------|------------------|--------|-----|
| **Tier** | Stable | Stable | Experimental | Experimental | Experimental |
| **Pricing** | Subscription | Pay-per-token | Subscription | Pay-per-token (via hermes) | Subscription + ACA compute |
| **Context Window** | Per-model | Per-model | Per-model | Per-model | Per-model (inner Copilot) |
| **Tool Support (MCP)** | Yes | Yes (stdio) | Yes (built-in) | No (hermes internal tools) | Yes (always forwarded, not allowlisted) |
| **Streaming** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| **Best For** | Heavy usage, tools | Large context, pay-per-use | Full Claude Code toolset | Multi-provider model access | Untrusted/isolation-sensitive agents |

### Using Copilot

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: copilot
    default_model: gpt-5.5
```

Copilot is the default provider — `runtime.provider` can be omitted entirely. Requires an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`).

### Using Claude

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: claude
    default_model: claude-sonnet-5
```

Set your API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

### Using Claude Agent SDK (Experimental)

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: claude-agent-sdk
    default_model: claude-sonnet-5
```

Requires the `claude` CLI to be installed and authenticated. Install the SDK: `uv add 'claude-agent-sdk>=0.2.82'`

> **Note:** `runtime.mcp_servers` is supported — servers are translated into the SDK's own MCP config and attach alongside the built-in `claude_code` preset (a narrowing per-server `tools:` filter is refused, since the SDK cannot enforce one). Per-agent tool allowlists are not bridged: a workflow-level `tools:` block is rejected at `conductor validate` for any agent that omits `tools:` (it would otherwise inherit a list the CLI can't map). Omit `tools:` to grant the full `claude_code` preset; an agent's `tools: []` disables the built-in tools, though declared MCP servers still attach.

### Using Hermes (Experimental)

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: hermes
    default_model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-5
```

Install the library: `pip install hermes-agent`

### Using ACA (Experimental)

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider:
      name: aca
      pool_endpoint: "https://my-agent-pool.example.westus2.azurecontainerapps.io"
      inner_provider: copilot
    default_model: gpt-5-mini
```

The `aca` provider delegates an agent's entire agentic loop, tools, and MCP calls to a remote **Azure Container Apps dynamic-sessions sandbox** instead of running it on the host — useful for untrusted or isolation-sensitive agents (e.g. running arbitrary generated code). Unlike the other providers, `aca` requires the structured `provider:` form with a `pool_endpoint` pointing at an operator-provisioned ACA session pool (`scripts/aca/provision-pool.sh`) and `azure-identity` for authentication. Resolves its inner Copilot credential automatically via `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` → `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` → `gh auth token`, so a `gh`-authenticated operator needs no ACA-specific setup. See [`examples/aca-coding-agent.yaml`](examples/aca-coding-agent.yaml) for a full end-to-end example.

### Using a Local / Custom LLM Endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, ...)

`runtime.provider` also accepts a structured object that routes the
Copilot SDK at any OpenAI-compatible / Azure / Anthropic-shaped endpoint.
Useful for local inference (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) and managed
deployments (Azure OpenAI):

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider:
      name: copilot
      type: openai                          # openai | azure | anthropic
      wire_api: completions                 # completions | responses
      base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
      api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY:-ollama}
    default_model: llama3.1                 # match your endpoint's model name
```

The structured form is opt-in: a bare `provider: copilot` keeps the
default GitHub Copilot routing. See
[`examples/copilot-local-llm.yaml`](examples/copilot-local-llm.yaml) for
the full example (including an Azure OpenAI variant) and
[Configuration Guide → Custom Provider Routing](docs/configuration.md#custom-provider-routing-ollama--vllm--azure-openai)
for environment-variable fallbacks, security notes, and validator rules.

## CLI Reference

### `conductor run`

Execute a workflow from a YAML file.

```bash
conductor run <workflow.yaml> [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-i, --input NAME=VALUE` | Workflow input (repeatable) |
| `-m, --metadata KEY=VALUE` | Workflow metadata (repeatable; surfaced in `workflow_started`) |
| `--workspace-instructions` | Auto-discover `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and prepend to every agent prompt |
| `--instructions PATH` | Explicit instructions file (repeatable) |
| `-p, --provider PROVIDER` | Override provider |
| `--dry-run` | Preview execution plan |
| `--skip-gates` | Auto-select at human gates |
| `--web` | Start real-time web dashboard |
| `--web-bg` | Run in background, print dashboard URL, exit |
| `--web-port PORT` | Port for web dashboard (0 = auto) |
| `-l, --log-file PATH` | Write logs to file |

Output verbosity is controlled by **root-level options**, which must appear
*before* the subcommand:

```bash
conductor --quiet run workflow.yaml    # -q: minimal output (agent lifecycle and routing only)
conductor --silent run workflow.yaml   # -s: no progress output (JSON result only)
```

### `conductor validate`

Validate a workflow file without executing.

```bash
conductor validate <workflow.yaml>
```

### `conductor fleet`

Discover and manage every running `conductor` process — foreground,
`--web`, or `--web-bg`. See [Fleet Manager](#fleet-manager-tui) above for
the interactive TUI; these need no extra dependency:

```bash
conductor stop                # stop the only running workflow, or list them
conductor fleet list          # non-interactive table of every live run
conductor fleet               # interactive TUI (requires the `tui` extra)
```

See [docs/fleet.md](docs/fleet.md) for the TUI's screens, key bindings, and
status vocabulary.

**Full CLI documentation:** [docs/cli-reference.md](docs/cli-reference.md)

## Workflow Registries

Conductor supports named workflow registries — GitHub repos or local directories
containing shared workflows. Configure a registry once, then run workflows by
short name.

### Quick start

```bash
# Add a registry
conductor registry add official myorg/conductor-workflows --default

# List available workflows
conductor registry list official

# Run a workflow from the registry
conductor run qa-bot                       # latest from default registry
conductor run 'qa-bot@official#v1.2.3'     # specific tag (quote the #)
conductor run 'qa-bot@official#main'       # branch HEAD (re-resolved on fetch)
```

See [docs/design/registry.md](docs/design/registry.md) for the full design.

## Examples

See the [`examples/`](./examples/) directory for complete workflows:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [simple-qa.yaml](./examples/simple-qa.yaml) | Basic single-agent Q&A |
| [for-each-simple.yaml](./examples/for-each-simple.yaml) | Dynamic parallel processing |
| [parallel-research.yaml](./examples/parallel-research.yaml) | Static parallel execution |
| [design-review.yaml](./examples/design-review.yaml) | Human gate with loop pattern |
| [script-step.yaml](./examples/script-step.yaml) | Script step with exit_code routing |
| [set-step.yaml](./examples/set-step.yaml) | Set step deriving named values + boolean-routed branching |
| [wait-step.yaml](./examples/wait-step.yaml) | Wait step + script for a polling loop-back pattern |
| [wait-smoke.yaml](./examples/wait-smoke.yaml) | Minimal wait-only smoke test (no provider required) |
| [terminate.yaml](./examples/terminate.yaml) | Explicit `type: terminate` with success and failure paths |

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git
cd conductor
make dev
```

### Windows

On Windows, use `uv` directly instead of `make`:

```powershell
uv sync --all-extras    # instead of make dev
uv run pytest tests/    # instead of make test
uv run ruff check .     # instead of make lint
uv run ruff format .    # instead of make format
```

**Copilot CLI path:** Windows `subprocess` cannot resolve `.bat`/`.ps1` wrappers by name alone. If you see `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` when running workflows, set the full path to the Copilot CLI:

```powershell
# Find your copilot CLI
Get-Command copilot* | Format-Table Name, Source

# Set the path (use the .cmd variant from npm)
$env:COPILOT_CLI_PATH = "C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\copilot.cmd"
```

### Common Commands

```bash
make test             # Run tests
make test-cov         # Run tests with coverage
make lint             # Check linting
make format           # Auto-fix and format code
make typecheck        # Type check
make check            # Run all checks (lint + typecheck)
make validate-examples  # Validate all example workflows
```

### Code Style

- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type checking
- Google-style docstrings
