# Workflow Execution Guide

Complete reference for running, validating, and debugging Conductor workflows.

## CLI Commands

### conductor run

Execute a workflow:

```bash
conductor run <workflow.yaml> [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--input`, `-i NAME=VALUE` | Workflow input (repeatable) |
| `--input.NAME=VALUE` | Alternative input syntax |
| `--metadata`, `-m KEY=VALUE` | Workflow metadata, merged on top of YAML `metadata:` (repeatable; values stay strings) |
| `--provider`, `-p PROVIDER` | Override provider (`copilot`, `openai`, `claude`, `claude-agent-sdk`, `hermes`) |
| `--dry-run` | Show execution plan only |
| `--skip-gates` | Auto-select first option at human gates |
| `--web` | Start real-time web dashboard |
| `--web-bg` | Run in background, print dashboard URL, exit |
| `--web-port PORT` | Port for web dashboard (0 = auto) |
| `--no-interactive` | Disable Esc-to-interrupt capability |
| `--log-file`, `-l PATH` | Write full debug output to file (`auto` for auto-generated) |
| `--workspace-instructions` | Auto-discover `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` (only files marked `applyTo: "**"`) and prepend them to every agent prompt |
| `--instructions PATH` | Path to a specific instruction file to prepend (repeatable) |

**Global options** (before the subcommand):

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--quiet`, `-q` | Minimal output: agent lifecycle and routing only |
| `--silent`, `-s` | No progress output. Only JSON result on stdout |
| `--version`, `-v` | Show version and exit |

> **Note:** Full output is shown by default (prompts, tool calls, reasoning). Use `-q` for minimal output or `-s` for JSON-only. `--quiet` and `--silent` are mutually exclusive.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard run (full output by default)
conductor run workflow.yaml --input question="Hello"

# Quiet mode (lifecycle + routing only)
conductor -q run workflow.yaml --input question="Hello"

# Silent mode (JSON result only, no progress)
conductor -s run workflow.yaml --input question="Hello"

# Log full debug output to auto-generated file
conductor run workflow.yaml --log-file auto

# Silent terminal + full file logging
conductor -s run workflow.yaml --log-file auto

# Multiple inputs
conductor run workflow.yaml -i topic="AI" -i depth="detailed"

# Skip human gates for automation
conductor run workflow.yaml --skip-gates

# Dry run to preview execution plan
conductor run workflow.yaml --dry-run

# Override provider
conductor run workflow.yaml -p claude

# Attach metadata (merged on top of YAML metadata; values are strings)
conductor run workflow.yaml -m tracker=ado -m work_item_id=42

# Auto-discover workspace instructions and prepend to all prompts
conductor run workflow.yaml --workspace-instructions

# Prepend explicit instruction file(s)
conductor run workflow.yaml --instructions AGENTS.md --instructions notes.md

# Start real-time web dashboard
conductor run workflow.yaml --web --input question="Hello"

# Background mode: prints URL and exits immediately
conductor run workflow.yaml --web-bg --input question="Hello"
```

The `--web` flag opens a browser dashboard with a DAG visualization showing live agent status, streaming reasoning/tool calls, and an agent detail panel. The `--web-bg` flag forks a background process and exits immediately. `--web` and `--web-bg` are mutually exclusive.

Background workflows can be listed with `conductor status` (read-only), and stopped with `conductor stop` (see below) or via the stop button in the web dashboard.

### conductor status

List background workflows launched with `--web-bg`, without stopping any of them:

```bash
conductor status [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--json` | Emit machine-readable output instead of a table. |

Use this rather than a bare `conductor stop` to answer "what is running?". `conductor stop` with no arguments **stops** the workflow when exactly one is running, so the natural reflex is destructive precisely when there is a single run to lose. `status` never terminates anything, and it prints each run's dashboard URL, which is otherwise unrecoverable once the launching terminal is gone.

`--json` payload per running entry: `pid`, `port`, `workflow`, `run_id`, `started_at`, `stderr_log`, `stdout_log`, `url`. `run_id` is the join key to the run's events JSONL (`conductor-<name>-<ts>-<run_id>.events.jsonl`); `stderr_log`/`stdout_log` are the child's captured console output paths. All three are `null` for a PID file written before this field existed.

**Examples:**

```bash
# What is running right now?
conductor status

# Machine-readable, for scripts
conductor status --json
```

### conductor stop

Stop background workflow processes launched with `--web-bg`:

```bash
conductor stop [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--port PORT` | Stop the workflow running on this specific port |
| `--all` | Stop all background conductor workflows |

With no options, lists running workflows and auto-stops if exactly one is found.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Stop the only running background workflow
conductor stop

# Stop a specific workflow by port
conductor stop --port 8080

# Stop all running background workflows
conductor stop --all
```

### conductor guide

Send mid-run guidance to a `--web`/`--web-bg` workflow without stopping it:

```bash
conductor guide [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--text`, `-t TEXT` | Guidance text (**required**) |
| `--port`, `-p PORT` | Dashboard port (auto-discovered if omitted) |
| `--token SECRET` | Auth token (also reads `CONDUCTOR_GATE_TOKEN`) |

Applied at the next step boundary, or immediately if paused.

**Example:** `conductor guide --text "Prefer Python 3.12 examples"`

### conductor update

Check for the latest version of Conductor and (optionally) launch the installer:

```bash
conductor update            # Check + print install command
conductor update --apply    # Check + launch installer (then exit)
```

The command:

1. Fetches the latest release from the GitHub Releases API.
2. Compares the remote version with the locally installed version.
3. **Default:** prints the OS-appropriate `install.sh` / `install.ps1` one-liner you can paste into a fresh shell.
4. **`--apply`:** spawns the install script as a fully detached process and exits the current `conductor` so file locks release. On Windows the installer opens in a new console window; on POSIX `os.execvpe` replaces the process. This is the only way to upgrade-while-running cleanly on Windows (in-process self-upgrade was removed because the running interpreter sits inside the venv that `uv tool install --force` is trying to recreate).
5. Clears the update-check cache on success.

If already up to date, prints a confirmation and exits.

The legacy `--force` flag is accepted as a no-op for backward compatibility.

**Passive update hints:** On every CLI invocation, Conductor checks for updates (cached 24h, 2-second timeout) and prints a one-line hint if a newer version is available. Suppressed when stderr is not a TTY, when `--silent` is set, when the subcommand is `update`, or when `CONDUCTOR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

### conductor resume

Resume a workflow from a checkpoint after failure. Run-flag parity: most `run` flags work identically.

```bash
conductor resume <workflow.yaml> [OPTIONS]
conductor resume --from <checkpoint.json> [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--from PATH` | Resume from a specific checkpoint file |
| `--provider`, `-p PROVIDER` | Override provider for the resumed run |
| `--metadata`, `-m KEY=VALUE` | Workflow metadata, merged on top of YAML metadata (repeatable) |
| `--skip-gates` | Auto-select first option at human gates |
| `--log-file`, `-l PATH` | Write debug output to file |
| `--no-interactive` | Disable Esc-to-interrupt |
| `--web` | Start real-time web dashboard for the resumed run |
| `--web-port PORT` | Port for the dashboard (0 = auto) |
| `--web-bg` | Fork a detached resume + dashboard process and exit |
| `--guidance TEXT` | Mid-run guidance applied before the resumed agent runs (repeatable) |

`--web` and `--web-bg` are mutually exclusive. The dashboard only shows events from the resumed agent forward — events emitted in the original process before the checkpoint are not replayed.

Intentionally **not** mirrored on `resume`: `--input` / `--workspace-instructions` / `--instructions` (restored from the checkpoint), and `--dry-run` (incompatible with mid-run resumption).

When a workflow fails, Conductor automatically saves a checkpoint to `$TMPDIR/conductor/checkpoints/`. The checkpoint contains all prior agent outputs, the workflow state, and the resolved `instructions_preamble`, enabling seamless resumption from the failed agent.

**Examples:**

```bash
conductor resume workflow.yaml                                            # latest checkpoint
conductor resume --from /tmp/conductor/checkpoints/my-workflow-20260303-153000.json
conductor resume workflow.yaml --provider claude
conductor resume workflow.yaml --metadata tracker=ado -m work_item_id=42
conductor resume workflow.yaml --web
conductor resume workflow.yaml --web-bg
conductor resume workflow.yaml --log-file auto
```

**Behavior:**
- If the workflow file has changed since the checkpoint was saved, a warning is displayed but resumption proceeds
- Execution resumes from the exact agent that failed
- All prior agent outputs and the workspace `instructions_preamble` are restored from the checkpoint

### conductor checkpoint list

List available workflow checkpoints:

```bash
conductor checkpoint list [workflow.yaml]
```

Shows all checkpoint files with metadata: workflow name, timestamp, failed agent, and error type. Optionally filter by workflow file.

**Examples:**

```bash
# List all checkpoints
conductor checkpoint list

# List checkpoints for a specific workflow
conductor checkpoint list workflow.yaml
```

> The flat `conductor checkpoints` command is a deprecated alias for
> `conductor checkpoint list`; it still works but warns and will be removed in
> a future release.

### conductor validate

Validate without executing:

```bash
conductor validate <workflow.yaml>
```

Performs both schema and **semantic** checks:

- YAML syntax
- Required fields and schema structure (unknown fields on `AgentDef`, `ParallelGroup`, `ForEachDef`, and `WorkflowConfig` are rejected, not silently dropped)
- Agent references and route targets
- Route reachability and `$end` reachability
- Template syntax
- Parallel group agent references
- For-each `source` format and reserved names
- Stale agent references and undeclared explicit-mode dependencies in `prompt`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `args`, `working_dir`, `input_mapping`, parallel-group inputs, and workflow `output:` templates
- Warning when an agent defines `system_prompt` but no `prompt:` (unusual because the user-authored task prompt would be empty)

The success summary table includes Parallel Groups and For-each Groups counts.

### conductor show

Show inputs, agents, parallel/for-each groups, and outputs for a workflow without running it. Accepts a local file path or a registry reference.

```bash
conductor show <workflow.yaml | workflow_ref>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
conductor show ./my-workflow.yaml
conductor show qa-bot
conductor show qa-bot@my-registry@1.0.0
```

Prints a sample `conductor run …` command pre-populated with the discovered inputs.

### conductor replay

Replay a recorded workflow run in the dashboard with a timeline scrubber:

```bash
conductor replay <log_file> [--web-port PORT]
```

The log file can be:
- A JSON array downloaded from the dashboard (`GET /api/logs`)
- A JSONL file written by the `EventLogSubscriber` (e.g. `$TMPDIR/conductor/conductor-<workflow>-<timestamp>.events.jsonl`)

```bash
conductor replay conductor-logs.json
conductor replay /tmp/conductor/conductor-my-workflow-20260101-120000.events.jsonl
```

### conductor registry

Manage workflow registries — named sources of shared workflows (GitHub repos or local directories).

```bash
conductor registry <subcommand> [OPTIONS]
```

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list [name]` | List registries, or workflows in a specific registry (also shows latest tags) |
| `add <name> <source>` | Add a registry. Options: `--type github\|path` (default github), `--default` |
| `remove <name>` | Remove a registry |
| `set-default <name>` | Set the default registry |
| `update [name]` | Refresh index and re-resolve latest versions |
| `show <ref>` | Show metadata for a workflow reference |

**Examples:**

```bash
conductor registry add official myorg/conductor-workflows --default
conductor registry add local /path/to/workflows --type path
conductor registry list                        # show configured registries
conductor registry list official               # show workflows in a registry
conductor registry set-default official
conductor registry update                      # refresh all indexes
conductor registry show qa-bot@official@1.0.0  # show workflow metadata
```

**Running from a registry:**

```bash
conductor run qa-bot                     # latest from default registry
conductor run qa-bot@official            # latest from named registry
conductor run qa-bot@official@1.2.3      # explicit version
conductor run qa-bot@@1.2.3              # explicit version from default registry
conductor run sdd/plan#main              # branch/tag/SHA via "#ref" suffix
conductor run sdd/plan#abc1234           # explicit commit
```

`latest` (and bare `name@registry` refs without a `#ref`) resolve to the **default branch HEAD**, not the newest tag — pin explicitly with `workflow#v1.2.3` for releases. Registry workflows are cached locally at `~/.conductor/cache/registries/`. Explicit refs are immutable; bare names re-resolve on `conductor registry update`.

## Execution Flow

1. **Load** — Parse YAML and validate structure
2. **Initialize** — Set up provider(s) and MCP servers
3. **Execute** — Run agents following routes:
   - Sequential agents execute one at a time
   - Parallel groups execute agents concurrently with context snapshots
   - For-each groups spawn N agent instances from runtime array
4. **Collect** — Gather outputs per schema
5. **Return** — Output final result as JSON

### Iteration Counting

- Each agent execution counts as 1 iteration
- Parallel agents count individually (3 parallel agents = 3 iterations)
- For-each instances each count as 1 iteration
- Loop-back patterns increment the counter on each cycle

## Cost Tracking

Conductor tracks token usage and costs automatically:

```yaml
cost:
  show_per_agent: true    # Per-agent cost breakdown
  show_summary: true      # Total cost summary at end
  pricing:                # Override default pricing
    custom-model:
      input_per_mtok: 3.0
      output_per_mtok: 15.0
      cache_read_per_mtok: 0.3
      cache_write_per_mtok: 3.75
```

Output includes input/output token counts and estimated costs per agent and in total.

## Debugging

### Default Output

Full output is shown by default:

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --input question="test"
```

Shows:
- Agent execution order
- Full prompt content (untruncated)
- Output received
- Route decisions
- Tool call arguments and reasoning
- Token usage and costs per agent

Use `--quiet` for minimal output (lifecycle + routing only) or `--silent` for JSON-only.

### Log File

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --log-file auto
conductor -s run workflow.yaml --log-file debug.log
```

Capture full debug output to a file. Combine with `--silent` for quiet terminal with full logging. Auto mode generates files in `$TMPDIR/conductor/`.

### Dry Run

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --dry-run
```

Preview execution plan without running agents. Shows the workflow graph, agent order, and configuration.

### Web Dashboard

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --web --input question="test"
```

Real-time browser dashboard for visualizing and interacting with workflows as they run:

- **Interactive DAG graph** — Zoomable, draggable workflow graph with animated edges showing execution flow and conditional routing
- **Live agent streaming** — Watch agent reasoning, tool calls, and outputs stream in real-time as each step executes
- **Three-pane layout** — Resizable panels for the graph, agent detail, and a tabbed output pane (Log, Activity, Output)
- **In-browser human gates** — Respond to human-in-the-loop decisions directly in the dashboard
- **Per-node detail** — Click any node to see its prompt, metadata (model, tokens, cost), activity stream, and output
- **Background mode** — Run with `--web-bg` to start in background, print URL, and exit

```bash
# Background mode: prints dashboard URL and exits
conductor run workflow.yaml --web-bg --input question="test"

# Stop background workflow
conductor stop
```

### Validate First

```bash
conductor validate workflow.yaml
```

Catch configuration errors before execution of new workflows. Reports agent count, parallel groups, for-each groups, human gates, and more.

### Check Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Workflow error |
| 2 | Validation error |
| 3 | Timeout |
| 4 | Max iterations exceeded |

## Common Errors

### "Missing required input"

```
Error: Missing required input: question
```

**Fix:** Provide all required inputs:
```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --input question="value"
```

### "Unknown agent: X"

```
Error: Route references unknown agent: reviewer
```

**Fix:** Check agent/group name spelling matches in routes.

### "Unreachable agent"

```
Error: Agent 'helper' is not reachable from entry_point
```

**Fix:** Add route to the agent or remove if unused.

### "Max iterations exceeded"

```
Error: Workflow exceeded max_iterations (10)
```

**Fix:** Increase limit or fix loop condition:
```yaml
limits:
  max_iterations: 50  # Max: 500
```

### "Timeout"

```
Error: Workflow timed out after 600 seconds
```

**Fix:** Increase timeout:
```yaml
limits:
  timeout_seconds: 1200
```

### Template Errors

```
Error: Undefined variable 'agent_name' in template
```

**Fix:** Check variable exists or use conditional:
```jinja2
{% if agent_name is defined %}
{{ agent_name.output.field }}
{% endif %}
```

### "Parallel groups must contain at least 2 agents"

**Fix:** Add at least 2 agents to the parallel group.

### "Invalid source format" (for-each)

**Fix:** Use dotted path with 3+ parts: `agent_name.output.field`

### "Loop variable conflicts with reserved name"

**Fix:** Choose a different `as` name. Reserved: `workflow`, `context`, `output`, `_index`, `_key`

## Human Gates

When workflow reaches a human gate:

1. **Display** — Shows prompt and options in terminal
2. **Wait** — Pauses for user selection
3. **Capture** — Records selected value and optional text input (prompt_for)
4. **Route** — Continues to the route specified on the selected option

### Skip Gates for Automation

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --skip-gates
```

Auto-selects the first option at each gate.

### Resolving Gates in the Dashboard

With `--web` or `--web-bg`, gates are also resolvable from the browser
dashboard's decision modal or the `conductor gate respond` CLI — no terminal
prompt required. This makes `--web-bg` (detached background) compatible with
`human_gate` workflows whenever the dashboard starts successfully: the launch
prints the dashboard URL plus a `conductor gate respond --port <port> --choice
<value>` hint, and the run waits for a web/CLI response instead of aborting.
If the dashboard itself fails to start (e.g. a port conflict), a gate reached
in background mode raises a clear error rather than silently hanging or
crashing. Foreground `--web` from a real terminal still accepts either the
terminal prompt or the dashboard, whichever responds first.

## Interactive Interrupt

During execution, press **Esc** or **Ctrl+G** to pause the workflow. An interactive menu appears with these actions:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Continue with guidance** | Provide text guidance that is appended to subsequent agent prompts |
| **Skip to agent** | Jump to a specific agent in the workflow |
| **Stop** | Stop the workflow entirely |
| **Cancel** | Resume execution as-is |

Guidance text accumulates across multiple interrupts and is injected into agent context.

Disable with `--no-interactive`. In `--skip-gates` mode, interrupts auto-cancel.

A `--web-bg` run has no TTY for this menu. Use `conductor guide --text
"..."` or the dashboard's **Guide** button instead — see
[`conductor guide`](#conductor-guide) above.

## Checkpoint & Resume

When a workflow fails, Conductor automatically saves a checkpoint containing:
- All completed agent outputs
- Current workflow state and iteration count
- Workflow file hash (to detect changes)
- Failure details (agent, error type, message)

Checkpoints are stored in `$TMPDIR/conductor/checkpoints/`.

```bash
# List available checkpoints
conductor checkpoint list

# Resume from latest checkpoint for a workflow
conductor resume workflow.yaml

# Resume from a specific checkpoint file
conductor resume --from /tmp/conductor/checkpoints/my-workflow-20260303-153000.json
```

If the workflow file has changed since the checkpoint was saved, a warning is displayed but resumption proceeds.

## Provider Configuration

### Override Provider

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml -p claude          # Use Claude for all agents
conductor run workflow.yaml -p copilot         # Use Copilot (default)
conductor run workflow.yaml -p hermes          # Use Hermes (NousResearch agent SDK)
conductor run workflow.yaml -p openai        # Use OpenAI provider
```

### Per-Agent Provider Override

Set `provider` on individual agents in YAML for multi-provider workflows:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: fast_task
    provider: claude
    model: claude-haiku-4.5
  - name: complex_task
    # Uses workflow default provider
    model: gpt-5.2
```

## Output Handling

Workflow output is JSON:

```json
{
  "answer": "Python is a programming language...",
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### Capture Output

```bash
# Save to file
conductor run workflow.yaml --input q="test" > output.json

# Parse with jq
conductor run workflow.yaml --input q="test" | jq '.answer'
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub Copilot authentication |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude provider API key |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI provider API key (when `provider: openai`) |
| `CONDUCTOR_LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) |
| `CONDUCTOR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | Set to `1` to suppress the passive update-check hint |

Environment variables in YAML configs support `${VAR}` and `${VAR:-default}` interpolation syntax.

## Performance Tips

1. **Use appropriate models** — Smaller models (Haiku) for simple tasks, larger (Sonnet/Opus) for complex reasoning
2. **Use `explicit` context mode** — Reduces token usage by only passing declared inputs
3. **Set timeouts** — Prevent runaway workflows with `limits.timeout_seconds`
4. **Use parallel groups** — Run independent agents concurrently
5. **Use for-each groups** — Process arrays in parallel with `max_concurrent` batching
6. **Set `max_tokens`** — Limit output length to save costs (especially with Claude)
7. **Use per-agent provider** — Pick the best model/provider for each task

## Debugging Checklist

1. [ ] Run `conductor validate workflow.yaml`
2. [ ] Check all agent/group names match between definition and routes
3. [ ] Verify entry_point exists as an agent, parallel group, or for-each group
4. [ ] Ensure all paths lead to `$end`
5. [ ] Test with `--dry-run` first
6. [ ] Check template variables are defined before use
7. [ ] Verify for-each `source` resolves to an array
8. [ ] Check parallel groups have 2+ agents
9. [ ] Review cost output for unexpected token usage
