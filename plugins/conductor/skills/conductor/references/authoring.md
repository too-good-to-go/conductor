    # / .github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md with applyTo: "**") so target-repo
    # context is loaded at run time instead of being baked into the YAML.
```

### Periodic Checkpoints (`runtime.checkpoint`)

Off by default — Conductor otherwise checkpoints only on failure, so a *stalled*
long run (provider hang, MCP deadlock, sub-agent that never returns) leaves
nothing to `conductor resume`. Enable periodic checkpoints to make stalled or
hard-killed runs recoverable:

- `every_agent: true` — save at every step boundary. Governs alone when true
  (`every_seconds` is then ignored).
- `every_seconds: N` — throttle: save at the first boundary past N seconds since
  the last save (set either trigger or both; a save fires when **either** is
  met). The first save of a run fires at the first boundary; the interval only
  throttles later saves.
- `keep_last` (default 5) — rotate older periodic checkpoints for the run;
  failure checkpoints are never rotated.

Semantics: checkpoints are taken at step boundaries (all prior outputs
committed) and point at the step *about to run*, so resume continues forward and
re-runs only that step. No background timer — if a step runs longer than
`every_seconds`, the recovery point is the boundary checkpoint taken before it
started. Root workflow only (sub-workflows re-run from scratch on resume), and
periodic checkpoints are deleted automatically at a terminal non-resumable
outcome (clean completion or explicit `status: failed` terminate). A failed
periodic save never interrupts the run — it emits a `checkpoint_save_failed`
event + console warning. See
`examples/periodic-checkpoints.yaml`.

    routes:                      # Where to go next
      - to: next_agent
```

### Reasoning Effort

`reasoning.effort` (per-agent) and `runtime.default_reasoning_effort` (workflow-wide) accept `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`. Per-agent overrides the runtime default. The provider translates the unified value to its native API:

- **Copilot**: forwarded as `reasoning_effort` on the session. Validated against the model's advertised `supported_reasoning_efforts`; raises `ValidationError` for unsupported combinations (skipped in mock-handler mode or when capability metadata is absent).
- **Claude**: enables extended thinking via `thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` with mapping `low=2048`, `medium=8192`, `high=16384`, `xhigh=32768`, `max=59904`. Auto-coerces `temperature` to `1.0` (logged at INFO) and bumps `max_tokens` to fit `budget + 4096` (capped at 64000, logged at INFO when clamped). Only valid on thinking-capable models (`claude-3-7-*`, `claude-opus-4*`, `claude-sonnet-4*`, `claude-haiku-4*`); raises `ValidationError` otherwise.
- **Hermes**: forwarded to the hermes-agent library via `reasoning_config={"effort": value}`. Support depends on the underlying model and hermes version. `max` is **not** offered on Hermes (its four-level tuple omits it); the provider re-checks the resolved effort against that tuple at execute time in addition to the static `conductor validate` cross-check, so `max` is rejected both statically and at runtime (including when a templated `effort` only resolves to `max` after rendering).

Both providers surface reasoning content via `agent_reasoning` events visible in the dashboard, JSONL logs, and the console at `-vv`. Not allowed on `script`, `human_gate`, `workflow`, or `wait` agent types.

```yaml
runtime:
  provider: claude
  default_model: claude-opus-4-20250514
  default_reasoning_effort: medium    # workflow-wide default

agents:
  - name: explainer
    prompt: "Explain this algorithm."
    # inherits 'medium'

  - name: architect
    reasoning:
      effort: high                    # override
    prompt: "Design the system architecture."
```

See `examples/reasoning-effort.yaml` for a complete example.

### Validator (semantic output validation)

`validator.criteria` (required) is graded by a **second LLM call** after the agent completes, returning `{passed, issues}`. On `passed: false` and `max_retries > 0` (default `1`, hard-capped at `1`; `0` = report-only), the agent re-runs once with a `## Validation feedback` section (the issues) appended to its prompt; the second output is final (no second validation loop). `validator.model` defaults to the agent's model.

Distinct from `retry:` (transient failures, same prompt) and `output:` (shape/type, not content). Provider-backed `agent` steps only (not `script`, `human_gate`, `workflow`, `wait`, `set`, `terminate`); works in the main loop, parallel groups, and for-each loops. **Fail-open** — validator errors / unparseable responses are treated as a pass with a logged warning, so a flaky grader never blocks the workflow. Validator (and any discarded first attempt) token cost is reported as a separate `<agent> (validator)` usage row. Emits `agent_validator_start`, `agent_validator_complete`, and `agent_validation_failed` events (surfaced in the dashboard and at `-vv`).

```yaml
agents:
  - name: code_reviewer
    model: claude-sonnet-4-5
    prompt: "Review the diff for bugs.\n{{ workflow.input.diff }}"
    output:
      summary: { type: string }
      issues:  { type: array }
    validator:
      criteria: |
        Verify the review identifies all null-safety issues, every suggestion
        is actionable, and no function names are fabricated.
      max_retries: 1
```

See `examples/validator.yaml` for a complete example.

### Skills

`skills` enables reusable knowledge or capability bundles for provider-backed agents. The Conductor distribution ships one built-in skill — `conductor` — which packages the YAML schema, execution model, and authoring patterns (the same content this reference doc covers) so an agent can evaluate, improve, debug, or generate Conductor workflows.

**Names and paths.** Each entry is either a registered built-in name or a filesystem path. The distinction is syntactic: an entry is a path when it starts with `.` or `~`, or contains `/` or `\` — everything else must be a built-in name, so a bare `conductor` is never shadowed by a same-named local directory. A path points at either a single skill directory (one holding `SKILL.md`) or a root of them, which expands to every immediate child holding one (not recursive). Relative paths resolve against the **workflow file's directory**, the same rule `working_dir` uses, so a skill can be versioned alongside the workflow with no per-developer install step and the workflow behaves identically from any working directory. Skill paths are trusted input — no allowlist applies, since the same file can already run arbitrary shell via `type: script`.

**`SKILL.md` frontmatter.** Every resolved skill must declare a non-empty `name` and `description` in valid YAML frontmatter. Use a block scalar whenever the text contains a colon followed by a space — `description: Does things. Triggers: a, b` is invalid YAML, and both the Copilot CLI and Claude Code skip such a skill *silently*. Conductor parses it and fails loudly instead, at validate time and at run time:

```yaml
---
name: acme-widgets
description: |
  Internal ACME widget conventions. Triggers: widget, acme widget.
---
```

**Tri-state per-agent field (resolved via list presence):**
- Omit `skills:` — inherit from `runtime.skills`
- `skills: []` — explicit opt-out (no skills for this agent, regardless of workflow default)
- `skills: [name, ...]` — explicit set, replaces the workflow default

**Workflow-wide default:** `runtime.skills: [conductor]` enables it for every provider-backed agent. Individual agents can override.

**Provider mechanism (same observable contract — "the agent has access to the named skill"):**
- **Copilot** — the resolved skill directory is registered on the SDK session via `skill_directories`, so the agent discovers and loads skill content natively (progressive disclosure via `SKILL.md` frontmatter). This is more token-efficient than eager injection.
- **Claude Agent SDK** — also native, through the Claude Code plugin surface: the plugin owning the skill is registered on the session and the skill enabled by its `<plugin>:<skill>` name. Skills the workflow did not declare are suppressed, so `skills: []` really is an opt-out and ambient skills from the machine never load.
- **Claude** and **hermes** — the loader reads `SKILL.md` plus every `references/*.md` file in the skill directory and prepends them to the agent's rendered prompt inside `<skills><skill name="...">...</skill></skills>` tags. Inserted between workspace instructions and the user prompt.

**Two provider-specific limits worth knowing:**
- `claude-agent-sdk` has **no bare skill-directory option** — a skill is enabled by name through the plugin that ships it. A path skill outside a Claude Code plugin is therefore rejected at validation time, with both remedies named (package it as a plugin, or run that agent on `copilot`, which accepts the identical skill untouched).
- Eager injection has no progressive disclosure: the whole body is prepended on every call and every retry. The bundled `conductor` skill alone is ~117KB (~29K tokens). `runtime.skill_injection` bounds it — `warn_bytes` (default 64KB) warns, `max_bytes` (default 128KB) fails the agent, either can be `null` to disable. Providers with progressive disclosure are unaffected.

Not allowed on `script`, `human_gate`, `workflow`, `wait`, `set`, or `terminate` agent types. Unknown built-in names fail when the config loads; unresolvable paths and malformed `SKILL.md` files fail at workflow validation time and again at run time.

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    skills:
      - conductor                   # built-in: ships in the wheel
      - ./team-skills/acme-widgets  # path: versioned next to this workflow
    skill_injection:                # only bounds eager-injection providers
      warn_bytes: 65536
      max_bytes: 131072
    skill_discovery:                # off by default
      sources: [personal, project]
      exclude: [scratch-notes]

agents:
  - name: workflow_reviewer
    skills: [conductor]             # explicit set, replaces the workflow default
    prompt: "Review this workflow for correctness..."

  - name: simple_agent
    skills: []                      # opt out even when runtime default is set
    prompt: "Do something simple."
```

**Discovering installed skills.** `runtime.skill_discovery` picks up skills already installed on the machine so a workflow need not enumerate a personal or team library. It is **off by default**, because an ambient set is the one part of a workflow the YAML does not capture — the same file can behave differently on a teammate's machine or in CI.

Conductor scans the locations itself and unions both CLIs' conventions, rather than asking each provider to discover its own. That is the substance of the feature, not an implementation detail: discovery locations are provider-specific, so a per-provider flag would give a `copilot` agent and a `claude-agent-sdk` agent **different skill sets inside a single run**. Scanning centrally also keeps the providers' own discovery off, which matters because Copilot's would additionally auto-load MCP servers from any `.mcp.json` in the working directory.

- `personal` → `~/.copilot/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`
- `project` → `.github/skills` and `.claude/skills`, in the workflow file's directory and each ancestor up to the repository root

Discovered skills join `runtime.skills`, so the tri-state is unchanged: an agent that declares its own `skills:` overrides discovery too. Sources are scanned in a fixed order (`project`, then `personal`) whatever order they are written in, so reordering cannot change which of two same-named skills wins. A skill named in `skills:` always beats a discovered one of the same name — which comes up immediately, since installing Conductor's own plugin puts a second `conductor` skill on the machine.

Discovered content is held to a laxer standard than declared content: broken frontmatter, a taken name, an unreadable directory, or a skill `claude-agent-sdk` cannot load are all errors for a declared skill and warning-plus-skip for a discovered one. The exception is a provider with no native skill surface at all (`claude`, `hermes`), where skipping would drop the whole discovered set — that combination is an error either way. The author asked for one by name and not the other.

Provider support is narrower than for declared skills. `copilot` is fully supported. `claude-agent-sdk` only loads a discovered skill that lives inside a Claude Code plugin, and most installed Copilot plugins are not — expect a warning per skipped skill, silenced with `exclude`. `claude` and `hermes` **reject discovery at validation time**: they inject every body into every prompt, and a discovered set is unbounded and machine-dependent, so no `skill_injection` limit makes it safe.

Run `conductor validate` to see what discovery found — it lists every skill, the location it came from, and the total size if eagerly injected.

There is deliberately no `plugins` source. Scanning a plugin's `skills/` reached into a plugin and took one of the three things it ships, leaving its subagents and MCP servers behind — the bug `runtime.plugins` exists to fix. Name plugins there instead; that brings the whole unit and, unlike a scan, reproduces on another machine.

See `examples/skills-self-improving-workflow.yaml` and `examples/skills-discovery.yaml` for complete examples.

## Plugins

A skill is instructions. A **plugin** is the unit people install, and it ships up to three things Conductor uses: `skills/`, `agents/*.agent.md` subagents, and MCP servers declared in `.mcp.json` or the manifest. `runtime.plugins` (and per-agent `plugins:`) opts into all three, on the same tri-state as `skills:` — omitted inherits, `[]` opts out, a list overrides.

```yaml
runtime:
  plugins:
    - prs                    # installed plugin: everything it ships
    - name: ./tools/mine     # path, relative to the workflow file
      mcp: false             # skills and subagents only
```

Enabling all three matters because they are written together: a plugin's `SKILL.md` routinely tells the agent to dispatch to `prs:code-reviewer` or call an `ado` MCP tool. Loading only the instructions produces an agent that reads them correctly, reaches for something never registered, and says nothing — which is why every component defaults **on**.

An entry is an installed plugin name (searched under `~/.copilot/installed-plugins/*/` and `~/.claude/plugins/*/`) or a path, classified syntactically exactly as `skills:` entries are. An uninstalled or ambiguous name is a hard error.

`mcp: false` is the switch worth knowing: an MCP server is a subprocess launched with the user's credentials, started at session creation rather than at first tool call. `hooks/` and `commands/` are never loaded, and `conductor validate` warns when a plugin ships them.

Supported on `copilot` and `claude-agent-sdk` only; `claude`, `hermes` and `aca` reject `plugins:` at validation time, since injecting text into a prompt cannot produce a subagent or an MCP server. Conductor deconstructs a plugin rather than registering its root, because both SDKs' whole-plugin surfaces are all-or-nothing — on Copilot, hiding an MCP tool does not stop its server launching. The one carve-out: on `claude-agent-sdk`, reaching a plugin's skills requires registering the root, which carries every subagent with it, so `agents: false` alongside `skills: true` is refused there.

Plugins are never discovered — a plugin loads because a workflow named it. `conductor validate` prints what each contributes, including every subagent by name.

See `examples/plugins.yaml` for a complete example.

## Routing Patterns

### Linear

```yaml
routes:
  - to: next_agent
```

### Conditional (first match wins)

```yaml
routes:
  - to: success_agent
    when: "{{ output.status == 'approved' }}"
  - to: failure_agent
    when: "{{ output.status == 'rejected' }}"
  - to: default_agent           # Fallback (no when clause)
```

### Loop-back

```yaml
routes:
  - to: $end
    when: "{{ output.score >= 90 }}"
  - to: self                    # Loop back to same agent
```

### Terminal

```yaml
routes:
  - to: $end                    # End workflow
```

### Route to parallel/for-each group

```yaml
routes:
  - to: parallel_researchers    # Route to a parallel group
  - to: item_processors         # Route to a for-each group
```

## Script Steps

Script steps run shell commands and capture stdout, stderr, and exit_code:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: check_python
    type: script
    description: Check the installed Python version
    command: python3
    args: ["--version"]
    timeout: 30                  # Per-script timeout in seconds (optional)
    working_dir: /tmp            # Working directory (optional, Jinja2 templated)
    env:                         # Extra environment variables (optional)
      MY_VAR: "value"
    stdin: "{{ data | tojson }}" # Payload piped to the child's stdin (optional, Jinja2 templated)
    routes:
      - to: analyzer
        when: "exit_code == 0"
      - to: error_handler
```

Use `stdin:` to hand large or structured payloads to a script without hitting OS command-line length limits (notably Windows's ~32 KB command-line cap). It is a Jinja2 string template rendered to the child's stdin as UTF-8 — use `{{ x | tojson }}` for JSON, or render text directly. Omitting it inherits the parent's stdin (legacy behavior); `stdin` and `args` can be set together (orthogonal).

### Script Output

Script steps always produce three fields:

```jinja2
{{ script_name.output.stdout }}     # Captured standard output (string)
{{ script_name.output.stderr }}     # Captured standard error
{{ script_name.output.exit_code }}  # Process exit code (0 = success)
```

If `stdout` is **valid JSON**, its top-level keys are auto-merged into the agent's output dict alongside `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code`. This enables structured `when:` route conditions instead of opaque exit-code matching:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: classify
    type: script
    command: python3
    args: ["classify.py"]                # prints e.g. {"category": "bug", "score": 87}
    routes:
      - to: bug_handler
        when: "category == 'bug'"        # field-based, not exit-code-based
      - to: triage
```

### Script Routing

Route conditions use `exit_code` directly (simpleeval syntax):

```yaml
routes:
  - to: next_step
    when: "exit_code == 0"
  - to: error_handler            # Fallback for non-zero exit
```

### Script Restrictions

Script agents **cannot** have: `prompt`, `provider`, `model`, `tools`, `output`, `system_prompt`, `options`, `retry`, `reasoning`, `dialog`, `validator`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, `session_key`, `timeout_seconds` (use `timeout:` instead), `input_mapping`, or `max_depth`.
Command and args support Jinja2 templating for dynamic values.

## Wait Steps (`type: wait`)

Pause workflow execution for a parsed duration via in-process `asyncio.sleep`. Cross-platform — no shell `sleep` dependency. Use for rate-limit cooldowns, polling intervals, and external-system catch-up.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: cooldown
    type: wait
    description: Cool down between API bursts   # Optional
    duration: 60s                               # Required (see "Duration format")
    reason: Avoiding rate limit                 # Optional, shown in dashboard
    routes:
      - to: next_call
```

### Duration Format

- Plain `int`/`float` → seconds (e.g. `60`, `1.5`).
- Suffixed string: `ms`, `s`, `m`, `h` (e.g. `"500ms"`, `"60s"`, `"2.5m"`, `"1h"`).
- Jinja2 template rendering to one of the above (templates defer literal validation to runtime):
  ```yaml
  duration: "{{ workflow.input.poll_interval_seconds }}s"
  ```
- Must resolve to `> 0` and `≤ 86400s` (24h). Booleans are rejected.

### Wait Output

Strict — only one field:

```jinja2
{{ wait_name.output.waited_seconds }}   # Actual seconds slept (may be < requested on interrupt)
```

### Polling Loop-back Pattern

```yaml
agents:
  - name: check_status
    type: script
    command: ./poll-status.sh
    routes:
      - to: process_result
        when: "status == 'ready'"
      - to: wait_then_retry

  - name: wait_then_retry
    type: wait
    duration: "{{ workflow.input.poll_interval_seconds }}s"
    routes:
      - to: check_status                  # loop back

  - name: process_result
    # ...
```

### Wait Cancellation

- `Esc` / `Ctrl+G` cancels in-progress waits immediately (the engine races the sleep against the interrupt event).
- Workflow-level `limits.timeout_seconds` cancels in-flight waits via the standard timeout path.

### Wait Restrictions

Wait agents **cannot** have: `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `tools`, `system_prompt`, `options`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `working_dir`, `timeout`, `workflow`, `input_mapping`, `max_depth`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, `session_key`, `retry`, `dialog`, `validator`, `reasoning`, `timeout_seconds`, or `output`. They also cannot be used inside `parallel` groups or `for_each` groups.

See `examples/wait-step.yaml` for a complete polling workflow.
## Set Steps

Set steps evaluate one or more Jinja2 expressions and bind the typed results into context. No LLM call, no subprocess, no I/O — these are pure context transformations. Use them when you'd otherwise duplicate a Jinja expression across many prompts, run `echo`-only script steps, or burn a model call on something deterministic.

```yaml
agents:
  # Single binding: output is the typed scalar / list / dict.
  - name: compute_slug
    type: set
    value: "{{ workflow.input.org }}/{{ workflow.input.repo }}"
    routes:
      - to: derive_flags

  # Multi-binding: output is a dict, accessible as step.output.<key>.
  - name: derive_flags
    type: set
    values:
      is_breaking: "{{ research.output.severity in ['high', 'critical'] }}"
      target_branch: "{{ workflow.input.branch or 'main' }}"
      effective_model: "{{ workflow.input.model or 'claude-sonnet-4-5' }}"
    routes:
      - to: breaking_path
        when: "{{ output.is_breaking }}"
      - to: safe_path
```

Exactly one of `value:` / `values:` must be present.

### Type Detection

Default (auto) detection uses safe YAML loading: booleans, numbers, lists, and dicts become native Python types; date-like strings are converted to ISO 8601 to stay JSON-safe; parse failures fall back to the raw string; empty renders become `""` (not `None`). Override with `output_type:` on a single `value:` to force `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `list`, or `dict`. Per-key typing on `values:` is not supported — chain steps if you need it.

### Multi-Binding Ordering

Every binding in a single `values:` step renders against the *original* pre-step context. Later bindings cannot reference earlier ones in the same step. Chain multiple set steps for ordered dependencies:

```yaml
- name: step_a
  type: set
  value: "{{ workflow.input.x | upper }}"
- name: step_b
  type: set
  value: "{{ step_a.output }}-suffix"
```

### Routing on Set Output

Routes attached to a set step see the bound value directly. Dict outputs expose `{{ output.<key> }}` (Jinja2) and bare `<key>` (simpleeval); scalar / list outputs expose only `{{ output }}`:

```yaml
# Multi-values: route on a derived dict field.
- name: derive_flags
  type: set
  values:
    is_breaking: "{{ severity == 'high' }}"
  routes:
    - to: hot_path
      when: "{{ output.is_breaking }}"
    - to: safe_path

# Single-value: route on the scalar itself.
- name: flag
  type: set
  value: "{{ workflow.input.severity == 'high' }}"
  routes:
    - to: hi
      when: "{{ output }}"
    - to: lo
```

### Set Step Composition

- Inside `parallel` groups: each member publishes its bound value to context. Templates cannot reference sibling group members (validator-enforced).
- Inside `for_each` as the inline agent: one bound value per item, accessible via `loop.outputs`.
- Output `value:` / `values:` chain naturally — a multi-binding step that publishes `items` can drive a downstream `for_each` whose `source:` is `step.output.items`.

### Set Step Restrictions

Set agents **cannot** have: `prompt`, `provider`, `model`, `tools`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `working_dir`, `timeout`, `workflow`, `options`, `input_mapping`, `max_depth`, `retry`, `dialog`, `validator`, `reasoning`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, or `session_key`. They count toward `limits.max_iterations` like any other step.

`output:` schema validation is permitted only when the rendered output is a dict (always for `values:`, sometimes for `value:`). A single-`value:` step with a declared schema that produces a scalar raises a `ValidationError` pointing to `values:`.

## Sub-Workflow Agents (`type: workflow`)

Reference an external workflow YAML file as a black-box step. The sub-workflow runs with its own engine and inherits the parent's provider configuration.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: deep_research
    type: workflow
    workflow: ./research-pipeline.yaml   # Required: path resolved relative to parent YAML
    input:                               # Optional: explicit input declarations (for explicit context mode)
      - workflow.input.topic
    input_mapping:                       # Optional: per-call inputs to the sub-workflow
      topic: "{{ workflow.input.topic }}"
      depth: "{{ research_planner.output.depth }}"
    max_depth: 3                         # Optional per-agent recursion cap
                                         #   (additionally bounded by global MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH = 10)
    output:                              # Optional output schema for validation
      findings:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: synthesizer
```

**Semantics:**

- `workflow` path is resolved relative to the parent workflow file.
- Sub-workflow inherits the parent's provider configuration.
- When `input_mapping` is omitted, the parent's `workflow.input.*` is forwarded as-is.
- `input_mapping` keys are sub-workflow input names; values are Jinja2 expressions evaluated against the parent's context.
- Recursive composition is supported with a global `MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH = 10`. Self-referential workflows are allowed; bound recursion further with `max_depth`.
- Each invocation emits `subworkflow_started` / `subworkflow_completed` events. The dashboard supports breadcrumb navigation and double-click dive-in.
- Sub-workflow output is accessible via `{{ agent_name.output.field }}`.

**Sub-workflows in `for_each` groups** — `type: workflow` agents work inside `for_each` groups for dynamic fan-out, with per-iteration `input_mapping` evaluated against the loop variable:

```yaml
for_each:
  - name: plan_issues
    type: for_each
    source: epic_planner.output.issues
    as: issue
    max_concurrent: 1
    agent:
      type: workflow
      workflow: ./plan-and-review.yaml
      input_mapping:
        work_item_id: "{{ issue.id }}"
        title: "{{ issue.title }}"
```

**Restrictions** — workflow steps cannot have `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `tools`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `options`, `retry`, `reasoning`, `dialog`, `validator`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, `session_key`, or `timeout_seconds`.

## Terminate Steps (`type: terminate`)

End the workflow with an explicit, structured outcome — distinguishable from a generic crash in CLI exit codes, dashboard state, and event logs. Real workflows have multiple legitimate end states beyond "the last agent finished": early success ("the document is already up to date"), soft abort ("no matching issues found"), hard failure with reason ("upstream service returned unprocessable data"), pre-condition not met ("this PR is from a fork"). With only `$end`, all of these collapse into "workflow completed" downstream. Terminate steps surface the distinction.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: precheck
    prompt: "Is the input safe to process? Return JSON: {safe: bool, reason: string}"
    output:
      safe:   { type: boolean }
      reason: { type: string }
    routes:
      - when: "not precheck.output.safe"
        to: abort_unsafe
      - to: main_pipeline

  - name: abort_unsafe
    type: terminate
    status: failed                     # success | failed (required)
    reason: "{{ precheck.output.reason }}"   # required; Jinja2-templated
    output_template:                   # optional; replaces workflow-level output:
      aborted: "true"                  # rendered then JSON-coerced ("true" -> True)
      stage: precheck
      reason: "{{ precheck.output.reason }}"
```

**Semantics:**

- Reaching a terminate step ends the workflow immediately — no routes evaluated after.
- `status: success` → engine returns the rendered output, CLI exits `0`, dashboard ✅, emits `workflow_completed { termination_reason, terminated_by, is_explicit: true, status: "success" }`. Runs the `on_complete` hook.
- `status: failed` → engine raises `WorkflowTerminated` (subclass of `ExecutionError`), CLI exits `1` (and still prints the rendered output JSON to stdout for downstream tooling), dashboard ❌, emits `workflow_failed { error_type: "WorkflowTerminated", termination_reason, terminated_by, is_explicit: true, status: "failed", output }`. Runs the `on_error` hook. **Intentionally not resumable** — the engine skips the on-failure checkpoint because the author explicitly chose this outcome.
- `output_template:` is a `dict[str, str]` where each value is a Jinja2 expression. The rendered values are passed through the engine's JSON-coercion helper, so `"true"` becomes `True`, `"42"` becomes `42`, and JSON literals (`'{"k":"v"}'`) are parsed. When omitted, the workflow-level `output:` mapping is rendered as on any other terminal path.
- **Sub-workflow boundary** — a `status: failed` terminate inside a child sub-workflow is downgraded to `SubworkflowTerminatedError` (also an `ExecutionError`) at the parent boundary. The parent treats it as a normal sub-workflow failure (its own `workflow_failed` does NOT inherit `is_explicit: true`). The child's rendered output, reason, and terminate-step name are preserved as `terminated_output` / `terminated_reason` / `terminated_by` attributes on the wrapper for `on_error` hooks and debugging surfaces. A `status: success` child terminate returns its rendered output cleanly and the parent continues with its next routes.
- **Branching on a child's termination** — if the parent's routes need to react to a child's outcome, the child should use `status: success` plus an `output_template:` carrying the relevant fields. Failed terminate is an error from the parent's perspective; parent `routes:` are only evaluated after successful steps.

**Restrictions** — terminate steps cannot have `routes`, `tools`, `output`, `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `working_dir`, `timeout`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, `session_key`, `max_depth`, `retry`, `dialog`, `validator`, `reasoning`, `workflow`, `input_mapping`, or `options`. Cannot appear as a parallel-group member or as a `for_each` inline agent — route to them from those groups' `routes:` instead. Conversely, regular agents cannot have `status`, `reason`, or `output_template` — those fields are rejected at schema validation to catch authors who forgot to add `type: terminate`.

See `examples/terminate.yaml` for a complete example demonstrating success, failure, and pass-through paths.

## Dialog Mode

Dialog mode lets an agent conditionally pause after execution and enter a free-form conversation with the user. A lightweight evaluator LLM call inspects the agent's output against `trigger_prompt` and decides whether to engage. Both Copilot and Claude providers are supported, and the dashboard provides dedicated UI (`DialogDetail`, `DialogEngagementPrompt`, `DialogOverlay`).

```yaml
agents:
  - name: researcher
    prompt: "Research the given topic thoroughly"
    dialog:
      trigger_prompt: |
        Enter dialog if the agent expresses uncertainty about
        the user's intent, encounters ambiguous requirements,
        or needs clarification before proceeding.
        Do NOT trigger for minor uncertainties the agent can resolve on its own.
    routes:
      - to: writer
```

Only valid on provider-backed agents (not `script`, `human_gate`, `workflow`, or `wait`). See `examples/dialog-mode.yaml` for a complete example.

## Workflow Metadata and Workspace Instructions

### Metadata

Attach arbitrary key-value metadata to a workflow for downstream tooling (dashboards, work-item trackers, audit logs). Surfaced in the `workflow_started` event payload.

```yaml
workflow:
  name: implement
  metadata:
    tracker: ado
    template_version: 3
```

CLI metadata is merged on top of YAML metadata (CLI wins on key collision; values stay as strings, no type coercion):

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml -m work_item_id=1814 -m sprint=Q3
```

### Workspace Instructions

Prepend workspace context to every agent prompt. Three options:

1. **YAML `instructions:`** — first-class field, persisted in checkpoints, inherited into sub-workflows. Best for self-contained workflows where the YAML lives alongside the code.

   ```yaml
   workflow:
     instructions:
       - !file ../AGENTS.md
       - "Always respond in English."
   ```

2. **`--workspace-instructions` CLI flag** — auto-discovers files by walking from CWD to the git root: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` (only files with `applyTo: "**"` in YAML frontmatter; scoped or absent-`applyTo` files are skipped per the GitHub Copilot convention). Best for workflows distributed via registry/skills where the YAML lives far from the target repo.

3. **`--instructions PATH` CLI flag** — explicit path to a file (repeatable).

All three sources are concatenated and prepended to every agent's prompt as a workspace preamble.

## File Includes (`!file` Tag)

Include external file content in YAML using the `!file` tag:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    system_prompt: !file prompts/system.md
    prompt: !file prompts/analyze.md
```

- Paths are **relative to the YAML file's directory**
- If the included file is valid YAML, it's parsed as a data structure
- If it's plain text (e.g., Markdown), it's included as a string
- Supports **recursive includes** — included YAML files can use `!file` too
- Circular references are detected and raise an error

Prompt files loaded via `!file` may also use Jinja loader-dependent tags
(`{% include %}`, `{% import %}`, `{% extends %}`); relative paths resolve
against the prompt file's own directory. `${VAR}` / `${VAR:-default}`
references inside those partials resolve at render time with the same
semantics as the root prompt file — an unset required variable fails the run
with a configuration error. The prompt file must still exist at run time:
if it was deleted after loading, rendering fails with an explicit error
naming the missing source path (it never silently falls back to inline
rendering).

## Parallel Groups

Static parallel groups run a fixed set of agents concurrently:

```yaml
parallel:
  - name: parallel_researchers
    description: Research from multiple sources
    agents:
      - web_researcher           # At least 2 agents required
      - academic_researcher
      - news_researcher
    failure_mode: continue_on_error  # fail_fast, continue_on_error, all_or_nothing
    routes:
      - to: synthesizer
```

### Context Isolation

Each parallel agent gets an **immutable snapshot** of context at group start. Agents cannot see each other's outputs during execution.

### Accessing Parallel Outputs

```jinja2
{{ parallel_researchers.outputs.web_researcher.summary }}
{{ parallel_researchers.outputs.academic_researcher.findings }}

# Error access (continue_on_error mode)
{% if parallel_researchers.errors %}
{{ parallel_researchers.errors.news_researcher.message }}
{% endif %}
```

### Failure Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `fail_fast` | Stop immediately on first failure (default) |
| `continue_on_error` | Continue all; proceed if at least one succeeds |
| `all_or_nothing` | Continue all; fail if any agent fails |

## For-Each Groups

Dynamic parallel groups process variable-length arrays at runtime:

```yaml
for_each:
  - name: kpi_analyzers
    type: for_each                 # Required discriminator
    description: Analyze each KPI
    source: finder.output.kpis     # Array reference (dotted path, 3+ parts)
    as: kpi                        # Loop variable name
    max_concurrent: 5              # Batch size (default: 10, max: 100)
    failure_mode: continue_on_error

    agent:                         # Inline agent template
      name: kpi_analyzer
      model: claude-sonnet-4.5
      prompt: |
        Analyze KPI {{ _index + 1 }}: {{ kpi.name }}
        Value: {{ kpi.value }}
      output:
        analysis:
          type: string
        score:
          type: number

    key_by: kpi.kpi_id             # Optional: dict-based outputs

    routes:
      - to: aggregator
```

### Loop Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `{{ kpi }}` | Current item (name from `as`) |
| `{{ _index }}` | Zero-based index (0, 1, 2...) |
| `{{ _key }}` | Extracted key (only with `key_by`) |

### Reserved Variable Names

Cannot use for `as`: `workflow`, `context`, `output`, `_index`, `_key`

### Accessing For-Each Outputs

```jinja2
# Array access (no key_by)
{{ kpi_analyzers.outputs[0].analysis }}
{% for result in kpi_analyzers.outputs %}
- Score: {{ result.score }}
{% endfor %}

# Dict access (with key_by)
{{ kpi_analyzers.outputs["KPI-123"].analysis }}

# Metadata
Total: {{ kpi_analyzers.outputs | length }}
Errors: {{ kpi_analyzers.errors | length }}
```

## Human Gates

Pause workflow for user decisions. Uses **list-based** options:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: approval_gate
    type: human_gate
    prompt: |
      Review the design:
      {{ designer.output.design }}
    options:
      - label: "Approve"
        value: approved
        route: $end
      - label: "Request Changes"
        value: changes
        route: designer
        prompt_for: feedback        # Collects text input from user
      - label: "Reject"
        value: rejected
        route: $end
```

### Gate Output

Human gates automatically capture:
- `output.selected` — the `value` of the chosen option.
- `output.additional_input` — dict of values collected from `prompt_for` fields.
  Always present; `{}` when no `prompt_for` was specified or the selected option
  has no `prompt_for`. Access individual fields via templates as
  `{{ <gate>.output.additional_input.<field> }}` (for example
  `{{ approval_gate.output.additional_input.feedback }}` when an option declares
  `prompt_for: feedback`).

> **`context: explicit` mode note.** `input:` declarations support
> `<gate>.output.additional_input` (the whole dict) but not the dotted shorthand
> `<gate>.output.additional_input.<field>`. Declare the parent key and read
> individual fields via Jinja2 in the agent's prompt or output template.

## Context Modes

### Accumulate (default)

All prior agent outputs available to all agents:

```yaml
context:
  mode: accumulate
```

### Last Only

Only the previous agent's output available:

```yaml
context:
  mode: last_only
```

### Explicit

Only specified inputs available — maximum control, minimal tokens:

```yaml
context:
  mode: explicit

agents:
  - name: agent
    input:
      - workflow.input.question
      - other_agent.output.result        # Required field
      - other_agent.output.nested.field  # Nested projection (deep path)
      - optional_agent.output?           # Optional (? suffix)
```

## Multi-Provider Workflows

Override the provider on individual agents:

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: copilot              # Default provider
    default_model: gpt-5.2

agents:
  - name: fast_classifier
    provider: claude               # Uses Claude for this agent
    model: claude-haiku-4.5
    prompt: "Classify: {{ workflow.input.text }}"

  - name: tool_using_agent
    provider: hermes               # Uses Hermes (NousResearch agent SDK)
    model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4
    prompt: "Use tools to research: {{ workflow.input.topic }}"

  - name: deep_analyzer
    # Uses default copilot provider
    model: gpt-5.2
    prompt: "Analyze: {{ fast_classifier.output.category }}"
```

when: "{{ output.score < 50 }}"
when: "{{ output.status == 'done' }}"
when: "{{ output.status != 'error' }}"
```

### Logical operators

```yaml
when: "{{ output.score >= 90 and output.approved }}"
when: "{{ output.retry or output.force }}"
when: "{{ not output.failed }}"
```

### String operations

```yaml
when: "{{ 'error' in output.message }}"
when: "{{ output.status.startswith('success') }}"
```

## Common Patterns

### Single Agent Q&A

```yaml
workflow:
  name: qa
  entry_point: answerer
  input:
    question:
      type: string
      required: true

agents:
  - name: answerer
    prompt: |
      Answer: {{ workflow.input.question }}
    output:
      answer:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: $end

output:
  answer: "{{ answerer.output.answer }}"
```

### Iterative Refinement

```yaml
workflow:
  name: refine
  entry_point: creator
  limits:
    max_iterations: 5

agents:
  - name: creator
    prompt: |
      Create content...
      {% if reviewer.output %}
      Feedback: {{ reviewer.output.feedback }}
      {% endif %}
    routes:
      - to: reviewer

  - name: reviewer
    prompt: |
      Review and score 0-100:
      {{ creator.output.content }}
    output:
      score:
        type: number
      feedback:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: $end
        when: "{{ output.score >= 90 }}"
      - to: creator
```

### Parallel Research Pipeline

```yaml
workflow:
  name: research
  entry_point: planner
  context:
    mode: explicit

parallel:
  - name: researchers
    agents: [web_researcher, academic_researcher]
    failure_mode: continue_on_error
    routes:
      - to: synthesizer

agents:
  - name: planner
    routes:
      - to: researchers

  - name: web_researcher
    input: [planner.output]
    prompt: "Web research on {{ planner.output.topic }}"

  - name: academic_researcher
    input: [planner.output]
    prompt: "Academic research on {{ planner.output.topic }}"

  - name: synthesizer
    input: [researchers.outputs]
    prompt: "Synthesize: {{ researchers.outputs | json }}"
    routes:
      - to: $end
```

### Human Approval Loop

```yaml
agents:
  - name: designer
    routes:
      - to: approval

  - name: approval
    type: human_gate
    prompt: "Review: {{ designer.output.summary }}"
    options:
      - label: Approve
        value: approved
        route: $end
      - label: Revise
        value: changes
        route: designer
        prompt_for: feedback
```

## Validation Rules

- `entry_point` must reference a valid agent, parallel group, or for-each group
- All agents must be reachable from entry_point
- All paths must eventually reach `$end`
- Route `when` conditions must be valid Jinja2
- Agent names must be unique
- Non-gate agents require at least one route
- Parallel groups need at least 2 agents
- For-each `source` must be dotted path with 3+ parts
- For-each `as` cannot use reserved names
