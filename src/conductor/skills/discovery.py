"""Discover skills already installed in the user's environment.

``skills:`` entries name skills one at a time. Discovery is the opt-in
alternative: point at *categories* of well-known location and pick up
whatever is installed there.

Discovery locations are provider-specific — the Copilot CLI keeps skills
under ``~/.copilot``, Claude Code under ``~/.claude`` — so the obvious
design (one flag, each provider asked to discover its own) would surface
**different skill sets to different agents inside a single run**,
depending on which provider each agent happens to resolve to. That is
non-determinism within one run.

Conductor therefore does the scanning itself, over the *union* of both
CLIs' locations, and hands the result to the same
:func:`~conductor.skills.registry.resolve_skills` machinery that explicit
entries use. Every agent sees the identical discovered set whatever its
provider. The providers' own discovery stays off — ``copilot`` is never
given ``enable_config_discovery`` (it would also auto-load MCP servers
from ``.mcp.json``) and ``claude-agent-sdk`` keeps ``setting_sources`` empty by
default (a workflow opts specific tiers back in via
``runtime.provider.setting_sources``, which is a deliberate per-workflow choice
rather than discovery).

Every mapped location is a *skills root*, so all three categories expand
by :func:`~conductor.skills.registry.expand_skills_root` — discovery adds
no second opinion about what a skill directory looks like.

**Discovered content is treated more leniently than content the user
wrote.** A broken ``SKILL.md``, a name already taken, or a directory that
cannot be read is an error for an explicit ``skills:`` entry and a
warning-plus-skip for a discovered one. The author asked for the former
by name; the latter merely happened to be installed, and failing a
workflow over a stray directory in ``~/.copilot/skills`` would make
discovery unusable.

Deliberately *not* provider names. The categories are what the user
recognises ("my skills", "this repo's skills"); which CLI happens to own
each concrete path is an implementation detail that Conductor unions
over.

There is deliberately no ``plugins`` source. Scanning a plugin's
``skills/`` reaches into a plugin and takes exactly one of the three
things it ships, leaving its subagents and MCP servers behind — that is
not a feature with a gap but the bug ``plugins:`` exists to fix (issue
#378). Scanning them is also wrong more often than it looks: of 13
plugins on one ordinary machine, 3 would be silently degraded and the 3
most plugin-like (MCP and subagent toolkits with no ``skills/`` at all)
would never be discovered at all. Name plugins in ``runtime.plugins`` instead, which
brings the whole unit and reproduces on another machine.
