"""Built-in skill registry for Conductor.

Conductor ships one built-in skill — ``conductor`` — pointing at the
``plugins/conductor/skills/conductor/`` directory inside the wheel. The skill
directory follows the Copilot/Claude-Code skill format: ``SKILL.md`` plus an
optional ``references/`` subdirectory of supporting docs.

The plugins directory is bundled as wheel package data via the
``[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel.force-include]`` entries in
``pyproject.toml``. Resolution prefers a package-relative location so
installed wheels work; it falls back to a source-checkout location for
editable installs and tests.

Entries written in ``skills:`` are resolved here: a bare name must be a
registered built-in, while anything path-shaped is resolved against the
workflow file's directory. Picking up skills already installed in the
user's environment (``~/.copilot/skills``, ``.github/skills``, plugin
roots) is opt-in and lives in :mod:`conductor.skills.discovery`, which
reuses :func:`expand_skills_root` from here so a discovered directory and
a written path are judged by the same rules.

    Walks up from ``skill_dir`` through its nearest
    :data:`_PLUGIN_SEARCH_DEPTH` ancestors looking for a
    ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json`` manifest. An ancestor only counts as
    the owner when ``skill_dir`` also sits under its ``skills/``
    directory, so an unrelated plugin further up the tree cannot adopt a
    skill it does not ship.

    The walk runs twice: once over the path as given (absolutised, ``..``
    normalised, symlinks left intact) and once over its realpath. The
    lexical view comes first because a plugin may ship its ``skills/`` —
    or an individual skill directory — as a symlink pointing outside the
    plugin root. Collapsing symlinks up front destroys the very ancestry
    this walk needs, so the owning plugin was refused with no diagnostic
    even though :func:`expand_skills_root` had accepted the same
    directory. The realpath view is kept for the mirror layout, where the
    manifest sits beside the symlink's *target* rather than the symlink.

    Args:
        skill_dir: Path to a skill directory (the one holding
            ``SKILL.md``). Resolved to an absolute path.

    Returns:
        The resolved :class:`SkillPlugin`, or ``None`` when no owning
        plugin root is found. Callers decide whether that is fatal —
        providers that can only load skills via plugins should refuse
        loudly rather than drop the skill silently.

    Raises:
        SkillPluginError: If an owning plugin is found but cannot be
            used: an unreadable or nameless manifest, a missing
            ``SKILL.md``, or a frontmatter ``name`` that disagrees with
            the directory name. Each of these would otherwise leave the
