    been fetched on this machine is therefore reported as a *warning*
    naming ``conductor plugin fetch``: the workflow is not wrong, the
    machine simply has not fetched yet, and ``conductor run`` heals it
    automatically.

    A source that is *itself* wrong — a path that does not exist, a
    ``path:`` that escapes the checkout, a catalog that will not parse —
    is an **error**. No amount of fetching fixes it, and reporting it as
    a warning blamed the network for the author's typo and then
    prescribed a command that fails on the same input.

    Sources are resolved **one at a time**. Resolving them as a batch
    meant a single unfetched source discarded the whole table, so every
    other declared source — including a local directory sitting on disk —
    was reported as "has not been acquired". That also emptied the table
    for the per-agent checks, silently skipping the MCP-clash and
    dropped-component reporting this feature exists to provide.

    A source that is declared but never referenced is dead config and is
    reported too — it is the kind of thing that survives a refactor and

    Attributes:
        agent_refs: Root names referenced via ``<name>.output``,
            ``<name>.outputs``, or ``<name>.errors`` (deduped). Used for
            unknown-agent checks and undeclared-agent warnings.
        workflow_inputs: Names referenced via ``workflow.input.<name>``.
        agent_output_fields: Maps each agent name to the set of fields that
            were referenced via ``<name>.output.<field>``. The sentinel value
            ``None`` in the set means "bare ``<name>.output`` was referenced"
            (i.e., the whole-output object) — this distinguishes
            ``{{ a.output }}`` from ``{{ a.output.foo }}`` for field-precision
            analysis. Absence from this dict means no ``<name>.output*`` ref
            was seen (only ``.outputs`` / ``.errors`` perhaps).
        group_member_fields: Maps each ``(group, member)`` pair to the set of
            fields referenced via ``<group>.outputs.<member>.<field>``.
            ``None`` in the set indicates a bare
            ``<group>.outputs.<member>`` reference (whole member). The
            sentinel key ``(group, None)`` means the template referenced
            ``<group>.outputs`` with no member — all members are referenced
            implicitly.
        group_error_refs: Group names referenced via ``<group>.errors``. Kept
            separate from output refs because the engine's runtime semantics
            for ``.errors`` always copy the whole errors dict and never field-

    Uses Jinja2's own parser, so:

        does not produce a spurious reference to ``x``.
      - ``{% set x = ... %}`` bindings and macro parameters are excluded.
      - String literals are excluded: ``{{ x | replace("foo.output", "y") }}``
        does not produce a reference to ``foo``.
      - Method calls on outputs are detected: ``{{ a.output.items() }}`` does
        not emit a field ref to ``items`` (the ``items`` Getattr is the callee
        of a Call node and is treated as a method invocation, not a field
        access).

    A name is reported as an output reference when it appears as the root of a
    Getattr chain whose first attribute is one of ``output``/``outputs``/``errors``
    (e.g. ``agent.output.field``, ``group.outputs.member``, ``group.errors``).

    A name is reported as a workflow-input reference when the chain matches
    ``workflow.input.<name>``.

    Built-in namespaces (``workflow``, ``context``, ``item``, ``_index``, ``_key``,
    ``loop``) and any name bound by a Jinja2 scope are filtered out.

    Limitations (documented intentionally):
      - Bracket access (``a.output["bar"]``) is not detected. Detecting it
        would require walking ``Getitem`` nodes with constant string keys.
      - Dynamic field access (``a.output[var]``) is not detected.
      - Method-call detection is local to each chain — if a method like
        ``items`` is referenced without being called, it is still treated as
        a field for the unknown-agent check, but is filtered from field-
        precision checks via ``_DICT_METHOD_NAMES`` as a safety net.

          regression.
        * Explicit ``tools: []`` against a provider that still forwards the

          CLI tools — bar the ``Skill`` loader when the agent declares

          providers can honor, so ``tools: []`` would misleadingly pass
          validation while every MCP tool stays attached. This only applies

          Copilot and Claude Code skip such a skill *silently*, so this is the

        * The provider cannot deliver it: ``claude-agent-sdk`` has no bare

          unreachable there even though Copilot loads it fine.
