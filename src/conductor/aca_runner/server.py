"""FastAPI app implementing the `conductor-agent-runner` contract (epic E4).

Wraps a real ``CopilotProvider`` (the only supported ``inner_provider`` for
the MVP, per *DD2* / *Open Questions*) behind the wire contract shared with
the host-side :class:`~conductor.providers.aca.AcaRuntimeProvider`:

- ``GET /health`` — readiness + Conductor/runner version, so
  ``validate_connection()`` can detect host/runner version skew.
- ``POST /execute`` — deserializes an
  :class:`~conductor.providers.aca_protocol.AcaExecuteRequest`, runs the
  inner ``CopilotProvider.execute()``, and streams the result back as
  ``application/x-ndjson``: one ``{"type": ..., "data": ...}`` line per SDK
  event, terminated by a ``result`` (or ``error``) frame.

Not built by this epic (see the plan's Files Affected / task table): a
dedicated ``/interrupt`` endpoint (the host's in-stream interrupt currently
has nothing to land on inside this runner) and a runner-side
``max_session_seconds`` wall-clock guard (the capability is declared "as
runner-enforced" by E3, but no E4 task assigns building the guard itself).
Both are tracked as follow-up gaps rather than implemented here.
