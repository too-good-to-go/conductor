"""Tool generation: ``InputDef`` -> JSON Schema, and assembling the
generated ``mcp.types.Tool`` (FR3, FR5, DD5, E7-T4).

Known fidelity gap.

``InputDef`` (``config/schema.py``) has no ``enum``, no distinct
``integer`` type, and no ``items``/``properties`` for structured types, so
an ``array`` or ``object`` input publishes as an untyped
``{"type": "array"}`` / ``{"type": "object"}`` — valid JSON Schema, but one
that constrains nothing about the shape inside. This is an asymmetry
inside Conductor's own schema, not an MCP limitation: ``OutputField``
(``config/schema.py``) already carries ``items``, ``properties``,
``enum``, ``pattern``, ``minimum``/``maximum``, and more. This module does
not invent structure the workflow author did not declare; enriching
``InputDef`` toward ``OutputField``'s vocabulary is a natural follow-up
that would improve ``conductor show``, the Fleet Manager's New Run screen,
and this feature all at once (see the design's *Key Components -> 2. Tool
generator*).

No ``outputSchema`` is published (DD5): ``WorkflowConfig.output`` is
``dict[str, str]`` Jinja2 templates with no declared types, so an honest
schema cannot be derived from it.
