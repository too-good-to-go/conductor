"""Run lifecycle tools: status, bounded await, cancel, and list (FR6, FR7,
DD11, E10).

Data flows C and D from the design (*API Contracts*, *Key Components -> 4*):
a `run_id` must be answerable **before**, **during**, **at a gate**, and
**after** the run it names -- whether or not this server's own process is
still the one that launched it. The single :func:`resolve_run` (E10-T1) is
the one place that decides which of three sources answers:

```
read_run_record(run_id)  --found & alive-->  derive_run_summary(record)  (live)
        |
        +--not found / dead-->  read_terminal_record(run_id)  (finished cleanly)
                    |
                    +--not found-->  find_event_log_for_run(...)  (crashed)
```

Every public function in this module builds its result from
:func:`resolve_run`'s output rather than re-deriving status itself, so this
file never re-implements the state machine `fleet/summary.py::derive_run_summary`
(and, for a crash, `fleet/summary.py::_scan_events`) already owns -- see the
epic's own acceptance criterion: "Nothing here re-implements the stop ladder
or the status derivation."

**Note on `GET /api/info` enrichment.** The design's ASCII diagram above
(*Key Components -> 4*) shows the live branch as "enriched from ``GET
/api/info``". This module deliberately does **not** add a live HTTP probe:
`derive_run_summary` already yields everything `conductor_run_status` needs
(`status`, `current_step`, totals, `gate: GateInfo`, `gate_resolvable`) from
the event log alone -- the same event-log-first choice `/api/gate-status`'s
own docstring calls "strictly richer" than a live probe. What the resolver
*does* need from a live check is **liveness**, not `/api/info`'s payload: a
stale `RunRecord` whose process has already exited (but which has not yet
been pruned) must fall through to the terminal/event-log branches rather
than being reported as still `"running"` -- that is what
:func:`conductor.cli.pid.is_process_alive` is for below, matching the same
liveness gate :func:`conductor.fleet.records.read_run_records` already
applies to every record it surfaces.

    """``conductor_list_runs(status?, workflow?, limit=20)`` (E10-T5, FR6).

    Enumerates live records union terminal records, deduplicated by
    ``run_id`` with the live record winning -- the same run can appear in
    both sources in the narrow window between a `workflow_completed`/
    `workflow_failed` event and the process removing its own live record
    and writing its tombstone (the same race ``fleet/summary.py``
    documents). ``status="at-gate"`` is the query that surfaces every
    parked run (DD11's third bullet).

    Args:
        status: If given, only entries whose derived ``status`` equals
            this value (e.g. ``"at-gate"``, ``"running"``, ``"completed"``,
            ``"failed"``).
        workflow: If given, only entries whose ``workflow_name`` equals
            this value exactly.
        limit: Maximum number of entries to return, applied after
            filtering. Live entries are listed first (most actionable),
            then terminal entries (already newest-first, per
            :func:`~conductor.fleet.records.read_terminal_records`).

    Returns:
        A list of status-shaped dicts (a subset of :func:`_status_payload`'s
        fields -- ``run_id``, ``source``, ``status``, ``workflow_name``,
        ``started_at``, plus ``url`` for a live entry or ``ended_at`` for a
        terminal one).
