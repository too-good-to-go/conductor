"""Invocation layer: launch, bounded wait, and result shaping (FR4, FR5, G3,
G4, DD2, R3, E9).

The single most important property of this module (design's *Key
Components -> 3*): **a workflow tool call never executes a workflow inside
this server process.** ``invoke_workflow_tool`` always calls
:func:`conductor.cli.bg_runner.launch_background`, exactly the same
detached-spawn primitive ``conductor run --web-bg`` and the Fleet Manager's
New Run screen use (``fleet/launch.py``). The reserved ``_wait_seconds``
parameter (FR5) changes only whether *this call* waits for the detached
child before returning -- the run itself is detached either way (DD2), so a
dashboard URL is available unconditionally (G4) and every MCP-launched run
is gate-resolvable by construction.

Flow, in order (data flows A/B in the design doc):

1. Map the tool name back to ``(registry, workflow)`` through the
   catalogue's reverse map (E9-T1); reject an unknown name outright.
2. Enforce ``--max-concurrent-runs`` (R3, E9-T7) *before* anything is
   forked.
3. Resolve the workflow's on-disk path at its catalogue-pinned identity
   (DD6) and its declared ``input:``/``mcp:`` blocks, reusing the same
   registry primitives ``catalogue.py`` used to build the catalogue rather
   than a second resolution path.
4. Validate/fill typed inputs via
   :func:`conductor.fleet.launch.build_typed_launch_inputs` (E9-T2).
5. Launch, unconditionally detached, with ``skip_gates=False`` (DD11) and
   an MCP-launched metadata stamp (E9-T3).
6. Resolve ``_wait_seconds`` (FR5, E9-T4) and either return the run handle
   immediately, or poll -- emitting ``notifications/progress`` when a
   token was supplied (E9-T5) -- until a terminal status, ``at-gate``, or
   the bounded deadline (E9-T4/T5).
7. Shape the result: the rendered ``output:`` dict as structured content on
   completion, bounded in size (NFR6, E9-T6); a run handle in every other
   case.

Argument validation against a tool's ``inputSchema`` is the SDK's own job
(``@server.call_tool(validate_input=True)``, the default) -- this module
does not duplicate it.

    Returns a ``(content, structuredContent)`` pair -- the exact shape the
    pinned SDK's ``@server.call_tool()`` decorator accepts as
    ``CombinationContent`` -- so a future caller wiring this onto the live
    ``Server`` (e.g. a later epic's toolset dispatch) can simply forward the
    return value.

    Args:
        tool_name: The tool name from the ``tools/call`` request.
        arguments: The (already schema-validated, per the SDK) tool
            arguments, including the reserved ``_wait_seconds`` if the
            caller supplied it.
        catalogue: The frozen catalogue built at startup.
        options: The frozen startup options.
        tracker: This server process's :class:`LaunchTracker` (R3).
        registries_config: The configured registries; defaults to
            ``registry.config.load_config()``, overridable for tests.
        progress_token: The caller-supplied MCP progress token, if any
            (usually read from ``request_context.meta.progressToken``).
        send_progress: An async callable matching
            ``ServerSession.send_progress_notification``'s signature, used
            to emit ``notifications/progress`` during a bounded wait
            (E9-T5). ``None`` (the default) silently disables progress
            regardless of ``progress_token``.

    Raises:
        UnknownToolError: If ``tool_name`` isn't in the catalogue, or its
            workflow can no longer be resolved (E9-T1).
