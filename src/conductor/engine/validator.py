"""Semantic output validator for the ``validator:`` agent block (issue #220).

After a provider-backed agent completes, :class:`OutputValidator` runs a
**second LLM call** that grades the primary output against a user-defined
rubric (``validator.criteria``). It returns a structured
:class:`ValidationOutcome` describing whether the output passed and, if not,
the concrete issues to fix.

This module is deliberately side-effect free: it does not emit workflow
events or record usage. It returns the raw :class:`AgentOutput` from the
validator call so the engine helper can attribute token cost to a separate
``"<agent> (validator)"`` usage row and emit the ``agent_validator_start`` /
``agent_validator_complete`` / ``agent_validation_failed`` events.

The validator runs as a synthetic agent through the provider's normal
``execute()`` path (with an ``output:`` schema of
``{"passed": bool, "issues": [str]}`` and no tools). Unlike
``execute_dialog_turn`` this yields a full ``AgentOutput`` with token
counts and works on every provider that implements ``execute`` — including
the experimental ``claude-agent-sdk`` provider.

Validation is **fail-open**: if the validator call raises or returns
unparseable output, the outcome is treated as a pass (with a logged
warning) so a flaky grader never blocks an otherwise-valid workflow.
