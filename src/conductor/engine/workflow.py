        Args:

            provider: Single provider for backward compatibility (deprecated).
                If both provider and registry are None, agents cannot be executed.
            registry: Provider registry for multi-provider support.
                When provided, each agent can use a different provider based
                on the agent's ``provider`` field or the workflow default.
            skip_gates: If True, auto-selects first option at human gates.
            workflow_path: Path to the workflow YAML file. Used for checkpoint
                metadata when saving state on failure.
            interrupt_event: Optional asyncio.Event for interrupt signaling.
                When set, the engine checks for user interrupts between agents.
            event_emitter: Optional event emitter for publishing workflow events.
                When provided, the engine emits events at each execution point
                (agent start/complete, routing, parallel groups, etc.).
                When None, zero overhead (early return in _emit()).
            keyboard_listener: Optional keyboard listener to suspend/resume
                around interactive prompts (human gates, max iterations).
                When provided, the listener is suspended before stdin reads
                and resumed afterward, preventing cbreak mode conflicts.
            web_dashboard: Optional web dashboard for bidirectional gate input.
                When provided and connected, gate input is accepted from
                both CLI stdin and web UI, with first response winning.
            _subworkflow_depth: Current nesting depth for sub-workflow composition.
                Used internally to enforce MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH. Callers should
                not set this directly.
            _dashboard_context_path: Slot-key path identifying this engine's
                position in the recursive sub-workflow tree. Root engine = ``[]``.
                Sub-workflow engines spawned via ``_execute_subworkflow`` get
                ``[*parent_path, slot_key]``. Used by ``_emit`` to auto-stamp
                ``subworkflow_path`` on outgoing events so the dashboard can
                route per-context state under concurrency. Callers should not
                set this directly.
            instructions_preamble: Optional workspace instructions text to prepend
                to every agent's rendered prompt. Built from auto-discovered
                workspace files, YAML ``instructions`` field, and/or CLI
                ``--instructions`` flags. Inherited by sub-workflows.
            plugin_marketplaces: Marketplaces resolved from
                ``runtime.plugin_sources``, keyed by the name a
                ``plugin@marketplace`` entry references. Resolved once by
                the CLI before the engine starts — acquiring a git source
                mid-run would stall an agent on a network round trip, and
                a failure there would surface as an agent error rather
                than a configuration one. Inherited by sub-workflows.
            _guidance_channel: Shared mid-run guidance channel (issue #400).
                When None, a fresh :class:`GuidanceChannel` is created. Child
                engines inherit the parent's channel so a paused sub-workflow
                agent can be corrected too. Callers should not set this
                directly.

        Note:
            If both provider and registry are provided, registry takes precedence.
            The single provider parameter is deprecated but still supported for
            backward compatibility.

           backward-compatibility for bare names like ``analysis`` that refer
           to a sibling file without a ``.yaml`` extension.

            YAML extension) and the parent workflow lives inside a registry
            cache, attempt to auto-fetch a sibling workflow from the same
            registry+SHA via
            :func:`~conductor.registry.cache.auto_fetch_relative_workflow`.
            This handles cross-workflow refs like
            ``../document-review/workflow.yaml`` between workflows in the
            same registry repo.
        2. Otherwise, parse as a registry reference via
           :func:`~conductor.registry.resolver.resolve_ref`.
        3. If the parsed ref is still a file kind (e.g. a path with a
           ``.yaml`` extension that does not exist), return the resolved
           path so the caller can emit a clear "file not found" error.
        4. For registry refs, fetch the workflow (with caching) and return
           the cached local path.

        Note on checkpoint/resume: this helper is called (memoized once per
        run, see ``_resolve_subworkflow_path``) on every sub-workflow
        execution, including after :meth:`resume`. Pinned registry refs
        (``name@registry#v1.2.3`` or ``name@registry#<sha>``) always resolve
        to the same cached path. Mutable refs (``name@registry#main`` or no
        ``#ref`` defaulting to "latest") may resolve to a different commit on
        resume if the upstream branch has moved. Use pinned tags or commit
        SHAs in production workflows when deterministic resume is required.

        Best-effort bridge between the async :meth:`AgentProvider.get_model_pricing`
        hook and the synchronous :meth:`UsageTracker.record` (see #265). Resolves
        the agent's provider once per distinct model, stores any returned
        :class:`ModelPricing` on the tracker so ``record`` can price it, and
        remembers the attempt — even a ``None`` result — so each model is queried
        at most once per run. Call it immediately before ``usage_tracker.record``.

        Concurrency: parallel groups and for-each batches run several agents that
        usually share the same model. A per-model :class:`asyncio.Lock` serializes
        resolution, and the model is added to ``_pricing_resolved_models`` **only
        after** the resolution attempt completes (a price cached, or the model
        left unpriced) — so a sibling coroutine that arrives while the first is
        still awaiting the hook waits on the lock rather than racing ahead to
        ``record`` and mis-recording the model as unpriced.

        Never raises: pricing metadata is optional and must not interrupt
        execution. On any failure the model simply stays unpriced (falling
        through to the static table), which the summary now surfaces.

        Known limitation: pricing is cached by model *name* only (the sync
        ``record`` looks up cost by ``output.model`` and has no provider handle),
        so in the rare case where two providers in one run serve the same model
        name at different rates, the first to resolve wins for both. This is
        unreachable today (only ``CopilotProvider`` overrides ``get_model_pricing``;
        all others inherit the ``None`` base). Revisit — by keying pricing per
        ``(provider, model)`` or returning the price inline to ``record`` — when a
        second provider implements the hook. Acceptable for a best-effort estimate.

        wrapper (``conductor.cli.run._execute_with_stop_signal``) while an agent
        is mid-execution. That cancellation unwinds through the engine's
        ``except asyncio.CancelledError`` arm, which deliberately does *not*
        emit ``workflow_failed`` or save a checkpoint. Without this method the
        user would lose all progress with no checkpoint and no failure event.

        Called by the CLI *after* the cancelled engine task has been fully
        drained, so reading ``self.context`` / ``self._current_agent_name`` /
        ``self.limits`` is safe. Saves a best-effort checkpoint (resuming
        re-runs the in-flight agent, identical to the pause -> Kill path) and

        ``checkpoint_unavailable_reason`` instead so the UI/CLI can explain the

        Idempotent: the CLI only calls this when the engine task was genuinely
        *cancelled* (its own terminal ``except`` arms re-raise out of the engine
        and are handled separately by the wrapper). The ``_dashboard_stop_handled``
        flag is a defensive backstop against repeat or direct invocation: once

        duplicate events. (It uses a dedicated flag rather than
        ``_last_checkpoint_path is not None`` because periodic checkpoints,

        - No web dashboard + bg mode (the dashboard failed to start in a
          ``--web-bg`` child): neither input source can be used safely — the

          ``HumanGateError`` instead of falling through to it.

          race the CLI prompt against the web response; first wins.
        - Web dashboard attached + CLI NOT usable (bg mode or non-TTY
          stdin): **web-only** wait. The CLI prompt is deliberately NOT
          invoked because ``Prompt.ask`` would synchronously raise
          ``EOFError`` (stdin=DEVNULL in ``--web-bg``), race-win
          ``FIRST_COMPLETED``, cancel the web arm, and crash the workflow —
          the original ``--web-bg`` + ``human_gate`` bug. A parked web-only
          gate is ended by the outer ``_execute_with_stop_signal`` kill path
          (which cancels this await and checkpoints via

        """Run an agent's ``validator:`` and, on failure, re-run the primary once.

        Mechanics (issue #220):

        1. Render the primary agent's prompt and run a second LLM call
           (:class:`OutputValidator`) that grades ``output`` against
           ``agent.validator.criteria``. The call is bounded by the agent's
           ``timeout_seconds`` and is cancellable via interrupt; a timeout or
           error fails open (treated as a pass with ``errored=True``).
        2. Record the validator call as a separate ``"<agent> (validator)"``
           usage row and emit ``agent_validator_start`` /
           ``agent_validator_complete``.
        3. If it passes, return ``output`` unchanged (no failure event).
        4. Otherwise emit ``agent_validation_failed`` (always, on every
           failure — including ``max_retries == 0``). When ``max_retries > 0``,
           re-run the primary agent exactly once with a ``## Validation
           feedback`` section appended and take the re-run output as final
           (no second validation loop). When ``max_retries == 0``, return
           ``output`` unchanged.

        Validation is fail-open: a validator error never blocks the workflow
        (the original output flows through). Cost accounting: the
        ``"<agent> (validator)"`` usage rows capture the grading call and, when
        a re-run succeeds, the discarded first attempt (two rows sharing that
        label) — so the primary row reflects the effective output while the
        validator rows make the feature's extra cost explicit. If the re-run
        itself fails (or is interrupted), the original output is returned and
        recorded once by the caller under the primary name — it is *not* also
        attributed to the validator row.

        Args:
            agent: The primary agent (must have ``validator`` set).
            output: The primary agent's output.
            primary_elapsed: Wall-clock seconds the primary execution took
                (used to attribute the discarded run's time on re-run).
            agent_context: Context the primary agent executed against.
            executor: Executor (and provider) for the primary agent.
            guidance_section: Any guidance already appended to the primary
                prompt; the validation feedback is appended after it on re-run.
            event_callback: Callback used to emit validator events and stream
                re-run events with the correct agent/item tagging. May be
                ``None`` when no emitter is configured.
            usage_label: Base name for the validator usage row(s). Defaults to
                ``agent.name``; for-each iterations pass the qualified
                ``"<group>[<key>]"`` label so the validator row matches the
                primary row's naming convention.

        Returns:
            The final output (original, or the re-run output on failure).
