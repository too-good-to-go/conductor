"""Run record read/write/prune primitives (Fleet Manager E1 — Run record core).

Every ``conductor run`` invocation (foreground, foreground-with-dashboard, or
``--web-bg``) writes a small JSON record here so that ``conductor stop`` and a
future ``conductor fleet`` TUI can discover it — see the design's *The fix*
section in ``docs/projects/fleet-manager/fleet-manager.design.md``.

Design points this module implements:

- **Keyed by ``run_id``, not port.** Foreground runs have no port, and port
  was already a poor key (stale, colliding ``.pid`` files).
- **Nine fields**, exactly: ``run_id``, ``pid``, ``workflow_path``,
  ``workflow_name``, ``started_at``, ``event_log_path``, ``port`` (nullable),
  ``mode`` (``fg`` / ``fg-web`` / ``bg``), ``checkpoint_dir``.
- **Atomic writes** (temp file in the same directory + ``os.replace``) so a
  reader never observes a partially-written record.
- **Tolerant readers.** ``read_run_records()`` mirrors the existing posture of
  ``cli.pid.read_pid_files()``: a corrupt, vanished, or unparseable file is
  removed rather than raised. ``read_run_record()`` (the single-key lookup)
  is stricter about *not* deleting on a parse failure, since a concurrent
  atomic write is the expected reason a read might transiently fail.
- **Liveness** delegates to :func:`conductor.cli.pid.is_process_alive` — the
  one process-probe implementation in the repo, already hardened for
  Windows footguns (issues #166, #344). This module does not reimplement it.
- **Legacy tolerance.** Pre-upgrade ``--web-bg`` runs left port-keyed
  ``*.pid`` files (via ``cli.pid.write_pid_file``) under the *default*
  ``cli.pid.pid_dir()`` (``~/.conductor/runs/``, which does **not** honor
  ``CONDUCTOR_HOME``). ``read_run_records()`` reads those too, surfacing them
  as ``RunRecord``s with ``mode="bg"`` (so D1's stop-confirmation gate never
  prompts for them) and best-effort field mapping rather than dropping or
  crashing on the unfamiliar shape.
- **The ``run_id`` contract itself lives in :mod:`conductor.run_id`**, not
  here — that leaf module is shared with
  :class:`conductor.engine.event_log.EventLogSubscriber` (which must not
  import this module, since it would drag in ``conductor.cli``) and with
  the filename parsers in ``fleet/history.py`` / ``fleet/retention.py``.
  ``is_valid_run_id`` is re-exported from here (rather than only available
  from ``conductor.run_id``) purely for backward compatibility with
  ``cli.bg_runner`` and the existing test suite, which import it from this
  module.

Also implements the **terminal run record** (MCP server plan E2 — see
``docs/projects/mcp-server/conductor-mcp.design.md``'s *Key Components → 4*
and *Why a subdirectory, not a sibling file*). A completed run's ``finally``
block writes a :class:`TerminalRunRecord` companion to
``run_records_dir()/"terminal"/<run_id>.json``, carrying the run's
identifying fields plus its terminal status, rendered output, error, and
usage totals — so `conductor status` / `fleet list` / a future MCP
`conductor_run_status` tool can resolve a run by ``run_id`` *after* its
process has exited, not only while it is alive. The subdirectory placement
is deliberate: ``run_records_dir().glob("*.json")`` (used non-recursively by
``read_run_records()``, ``scan_run_records()``, and
``remove_run_record_for_current_process()``) never lists anything under
``terminal/``, so a terminal record can never be mistaken for — or race
against — a live one.

    ``os.replace``/``os.unlink``/``os.rename`` fail with ``PermissionError``
    (``ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED``/``ERROR_SHARING_VIOLATION``): ``os.replace``
    contends on its *destination* (the file being written), while
    ``os.unlink``/``os.rename`` contend on their *source* (the file being
    read). CPython opening files without ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` is one
    contributor; antivirus and indexer handles routinely hold the same kind
    of lock. POSIX ``rename``/``unlink`` are unaffected by a concurrent
    reader and never fail this way.

    ``op`` is called with no arguments and is expected to raise on failure
    (never return a status code) -- callers close over whatever arguments
    the real syscall needs.

    ``FileNotFoundError`` is deliberately *not* retried: it means the target
    is already gone, which is the common case and must not cost a stall on
    every "already gone" call site.

    On non-Windows platforms this is a plain passthrough -- ``op()`` runs
    once, with no retry loop and no ``time.sleep`` overhead.

            raised it. On other platforms, if the single call to ``op``

        BaseException: Anything else ``op`` raises propagates unchanged and
            unretried -- only ``PermissionError``, and only on Windows, is
            retried. ``FileNotFoundError`` in particular surfaces

    Guards against a read-then-delete race: a reader may load a stale

    ``resume`` (or any other writer) can atomically replace the same
    ``run_id`` file via ``write_run_record``'s ``os.replace``. A naive
    "``stat()`` again, compare, then ``unlink()``" only narrows this race —
    it leaves a window between the confirming ``stat()`` and the ``unlink()``
    call itself where a concurrent replacement can still land, silently
    deleting the writer's brand-new, live record instead of the stale one
    that was actually read.

    There is no atomic "unlink-if-inode-matches" syscall exposed to Python,
    so this closes the gap using ``os.rename``'s own atomicity instead of a
    second, separate check: ``f`` is unconditionally moved to a private
    quarantine path in the same directory first (a single, indivisible
    filesystem operation — a concurrent ``os.replace(tmp, f)`` either
    completes fully before this rename or not at all; there is no
    in-between state either side can observe). Only *after* the move do we
    inspect what was actually captured:

    - If its identity matches ``stat_before``, it genuinely was the
      stale/corrupt file that was read — unlink the quarantined copy.
    - If it doesn't match, a concurrent writer's replacement won the race
      for the original path (this call's rename captured the *new* file
      instead of the one it intended to remove) — restore it, but only if
      nothing has been written back to ``f`` since (see
      :func:`_restore_if_absent`): a *second* writer could land in the gap
      between this function's own rename and the restoration attempt, and
      an unconditional ``os.replace`` restoration would clobber that
      second writer's file with the (older) quarantined one. Using a
      non-clobbering restore instead means the newest writer always wins,
      no matter how many races stack up.

    Args:
        f: Path to the record file to (conditionally) delete.

            snapshot is available (in which case this is a no-op).

    Returns:
        True if ``f`` was actually removed by this call. False if it was
        already gone, a Windows sharing violation on the quarantine rename
        outlasted the retry budget (see
        :func:`_retry_on_windows_sharing_violation`), a concurrent
        replacement was detected and restored (or superseded by a
        still-newer replacement, in which case the quarantined copy is
        simply discarded), or the final removal itself failed (e.g.
        permission denied) — in the quarantine-restore cases the original

    shows up in the TUI with every derived column blank -- current step,
    tokens, cost, topology -- while its log sits on disk beside it.

    Run ids are short (8 hex chars) and a resumed run deliberately reuses
    its predecessor's, so one id can legitimately name several logs — and a
    test suite that pins an id produces dozens in the very same directory a
    real run writes to. Adopting the wrong one would show a run's details
    against another run's log, which is worse than showing none.

    ``started_at`` is what resolves that safely rather than giving up: the
    same stamp the filename carries is already in the record, so a candidate
    is only adopted when its embedded start time is the single nearest one
    within :data:`_LOG_MATCH_TOLERANCE_SECONDS` of it. Ambiguity that
    survives that — no ``started_at``, nothing inside the window, or two
    candidates equidistant — still returns ``None``.

    Args:
        run_id: The run identifier to search for.
        started_at: The record's ISO 8601 start time, used to disambiguate
            when the id alone matches more than one log.

        The matching log's path, or ``None`` when there is no match, the
        match cannot be resolved unambiguously, or the directory cannot be
        listed.

        isn't a path-safe run id, the record is absent, it could not be

    terminal record is ``fleet.retention``'s job (matched to its run's
