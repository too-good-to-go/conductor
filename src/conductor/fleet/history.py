"""Enumerate completed runs from retained event logs (Fleet Manager E14).

The design's *Screens* section describes History as "completed runs,
subject to retention" -- this module is that enumeration, built directly
over ``$TMPDIR/conductor/*.events.jsonl`` (the same directory and glob
:mod:`conductor.fleet.retention` prunes) rather than the run-record
subsystem, since a completed run's record has already been removed by the
time this screen would show it (:func:`conductor.fleet.records.
remove_run_record_for_current_process` runs unconditionally in
``cli/run.py``'s ``finally``).

**A non-terminal log is not evidence of a live run.** The design's own
liveness measurement (see :mod:`conductor.fleet.summary`'s module
docstring: 228 false positives, 0 true positives inferring "running" from
the event stream alone) applies here too, with an even sharper
consequence: unlike ``summary.py`` (which is only ever handed a record
:mod:`conductor.fleet.records` has already confirmed live), this module
has **no** run-record to fall back on -- every file it enumerates might be
an active run's log, a crashed run's log, or a genuinely completed run's
log, and it cannot tell those apart from timing alone. So a log with no
``workflow_completed``/``workflow_failed`` terminal event classifies as
``"unknown"`` ("ended, outcome unknown") -- never as ``"running"``, which
would misrepresent a guess as a known fact.

Bounded by the same ``[fleet.retention].keep_last`` setting
:func:`conductor.fleet.retention.prune_event_logs` uses (E5), applied here
independently of the sweep's own ``enabled`` toggle: retention's
``enabled`` flag only controls whether files are actively *deleted*, but
this screen's list must stay bounded regardless of whether that sweep is
turned on, per *What single-user removes*: no long-horizon audit history,
no pagination.

    no "current" step to highlight).

    Events are assumed oldest-first (the natural order of a JSONL log and
    of :func:`_read_full_log`'s yield order). This function makes exactly
    one forward pass over ``events`` (a single ``for evt in events:``, no
    indexing, no ``len()``, no re-iteration), so it accepts a one-shot
    iterator -- this is precisely the property that lets
    :func:`_read_full_log` stream rather than materialise a list. A
    future edit must not break this by, say, iterating ``events`` twice.

    A **resumed** run always appends a fresh ``workflow_started`` after an
    earlier terminal event, whether or not a dashboard is attached --
    ``cli/run.py`` suppresses only the *engine's own re-emit* (so a live
    dashboard does not double-count nested-workflow depth), then writes
    the same payload directly to the event-log subscriber, bypassing the
    emitter, so the persisted JSONL always records the generation boundary
    either way. So a log can legitimately contain ``workflow_started`` ->
    ... -> ``workflow_failed`` -> a *second* ``workflow_started`` -> more
    activity. Any ``workflow_started`` past the first is therefore treated
    as the start of a new root execution generation: the previously
    recorded terminal ``outcome``/``ended_at``/
    ``reported_elapsed`` are reset back to their "no terminal event yet"
    defaults, so an in-progress resumed attempt reads as ``"unknown"``
    (never the stale prior attempt's outcome) until *its own* terminal
    event is seen (E14 review round 1). ``started_at`` is likewise taken
    from the **latest** ``workflow_started`` (issue #485, Q2): a resumed
    run's :attr:`HistoryEntry.duration_seconds` fallback (``ended_at -
    started_at``, used when no engine-reported ``elapsed`` is available --
    e.g. a resumed-then-failed run) should measure the current attempt,

def _read_full_log(path: Path) -> Iterator[dict[str, Any]]:
    """Stream-parse every line of a retained event log, oldest first,
    yielding one parsed event dict at a time.

    Delegates the actual line-reading and JSON-parsing to
    :func:`conductor.fleet.summary.stream_event_log` (issue #485), which
    made this exact choice -- an uncapped, streamed read bounded by the
    longest single line rather than by file size or event count -- for
    History first and generalized it for the Runs/run-detail screens'
    former bounded tail/head/full-log readers to share. History still
    reads a log once, after the run is already done, so there is no
    reason to accept a bounded reader's truncation trade-off: a byte-capped
    read can silently omit an early token/cost event or discard an
    oversized terminal event outside its window, presenting a genuinely
    completed run as ``"unknown"`` with an incomplete total (E14 review
    round 1).

    The generator holds the file handle open (inside ``stream_event_log``'s
    own ``with``) until it is exhausted, closed, or garbage collected --
    that ``with`` block, not any particular caller, owns the handle's
    lifetime. The sole consumer in production, :func:`_build_entry`, drains
    it to completion via :func:`_scan_history_events`; tests may consume it
    directly and abandon it early, which is exactly why the handle's
    release does not depend on caller behavior.

    Because this is a generator, none of its side effects happen when
    ``_read_full_log(path)`` is called -- they happen while the returned
    iterator is being **consumed**. In particular, ``open()`` (and any
    ``OSError`` it raises: permission denied, the file vanishing mid-scan,
    or any other read failure) surfaces on the first ``next()``, not at
    call time -- the delegated-to ``stream_event_log`` is always the
    *first* thing this generator's body does, before any size check, so a
    failure opening the file is never masked by an empty-file fast path.
    Unlike ``fleet.summary``'s former bounded readers' never-raise
    contract, such a failure is deliberately **not** swallowed: it
    propagates so :func:`build_history_entries`'s per-file guard can tell
    "genuinely no events" apart from "couldn't read this file at all" and
    skip the latter, rather than presenting a fabricated ``"unknown"``
    entry for a log it never actually read (E14-T4 / E14 review round 1).

    A malformed individual line (bad JSON, a truncated write caught
    mid-flush) is tolerated by the shared reader the same way it always
    has been here -- skipped rather than aborting the whole read. But a
    **non-empty** file that yields **zero** parseable events is corrupt,
    not "legitimately empty" -- E14-T4 requires a corrupt log to be
    skipped, not shown as an ordinary ``"unknown"`` entry (E14 review
    round 2). Raises :class:`_CorruptEventLogError` in that case, once the
    stream is exhausted; a genuinely empty (zero-byte) file still yields
    nothing and raises nothing, which :func:`_build_entry` legitimately
    turns into an ``"unknown"`` entry. Distinguishing the two now checks
    ``path.stat().st_size`` **after** the read completes with nothing
    yielded (rather than "at least one non-blank raw line", this
    function's own former signal) -- deliberately after, not before,
    because checking size first would let a permission error on a
    zero-byte file skip the read (and the ``OSError`` it should raise)
    entirely. The shared reader has no reason to track skipped-line
    counts for a live run's cheap, repeated poll, so this function no
    longer can either. A file containing only blank/whitespace lines --
    untested, and not known to occur in practice, since every write here
    is a single JSON object per line -- would now read as "corrupt" rather
    than "empty"; a zero-byte file (the only shape a genuinely fresh or
    truncated-at-creation log actually takes) is unaffected.
