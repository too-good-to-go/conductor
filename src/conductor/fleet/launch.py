"""Resolve and launch a workflow from the Fleet Manager (Fleet Manager E12).

Per the design's *Launch model: viewer, not supervisor*, the Fleet Manager
never supervises a launched run's process lifecycle -- it shells out to
``conductor run --web-bg`` (via :func:`conductor.cli.bg_runner.launch_background`,
called directly rather than as a subprocess) and forgets. Detached spawning
across platforms is already solved once in ``cli/bg_runner.py`` (issue
#116's forensic bg-log capture, Windows job-breakaway handling, and D2's
run-record poll gate) -- this module deliberately does not re-implement any
of it, since doing so would make runs die with the TUI rather than survive
it.

Three responsibilities:

* :func:`resolve_workflow` -- accept a file path or registry reference and
  resolve it to a local workflow file plus its declared inputs, reusing the
  same :func:`~conductor.registry.resolver.resolve_ref` /
  :func:`~conductor.registry.cache.resolve_and_fetch` pair ``conductor show``
  uses (``cli/app.py``).
* :func:`launch_workflow` -- validate required inputs, coerce raw
  (string-typed, as a TUI form widget would produce) values to each input's
  declared type, and call ``launch_background()`` directly. Any failure
  (a missing required field, a coercion failure, or ``launch_background()``
  itself failing -- including its own D2 run-record-poll timeout) raises
  :class:`LaunchError` with a plain-text message suitable for display in the
  TUI, never a raw traceback.
* :func:`launch_resume` -- resume a run from an on-disk checkpoint (issue
  #460, the History screen's Resume action) by calling
  :func:`conductor.cli.bg_runner.launch_background_resume` directly, for the
  exact same never-re-implement-spawning reason as ``launch_workflow``.
