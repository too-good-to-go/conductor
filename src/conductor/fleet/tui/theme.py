"""Shared visual vocabulary for the Fleet Manager TUI.

The single status-rendering vocabulary for every screen: one badge, word and
colour per status value, so the same run reads identically wherever it is
shown. Screens must not define their own glyph maps -- a per-screen map is
how "failed" and "unknown" end up landing with identical visual weight,
leaving a reader to parse the glyph to tell a healthy fleet from a broken
one.

Everything here is a *presentation* concern only. The status values
themselves are derived in :mod:`conductor.fleet.summary` and
:mod:`conductor.fleet.history`, which stay free of any rendering opinion --
this module maps those values onto badges and theme colour keys, and nothing
else imports it but the TUI screens.

Colours are **Rich style names** (``green``, ``red``, …), not Textual CSS
variables: these render inside ``Text`` objects handed to widgets, and Rich
resolves them against the terminal's own ANSI palette. Textual's ``$success``
/ ``$error`` variables are a CSS-layer feature and would be printed literally
here. Naming ANSI colours keeps them legible across themes *and* across the
user's terminal palette, which a hard-coded hex would not.
