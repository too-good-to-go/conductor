    groups of keys.

    The Runs screen's bindings are two different kinds of thing -- keys that
    act on the highlighted run, and keys that navigate the app or command the
    whole fleet -- and ordering them into blocks is not enough on its own:
    every key renders with identical styling and spacing, so a reader sees one
    undifferentiated run of nine keys and the boundary is invisible.

    Textual 8.x *does* have native binding groups
    (``Binding(group=...)``), but its ``Footer`` renders a group by dropping
    every per-key description and emitting a single label for the group -- so
    ``w Dash  k Kill`` collapses to a bare ``w  k``. That trades one
    discoverability problem for a worse one, since the keys are exactly what a
    newcomer cannot guess. This keeps the descriptions and draws the divider
    instead, reusing the ``vkey`` left border Textual's own stylesheet already
    uses to fence off the docked command-palette key.

    The divider is attached to the *first* key of the second block rather than
    emitted as its own widget, so it costs no additional footer columns -- the
    footer is a single non-wrapping line with no room to spare.
