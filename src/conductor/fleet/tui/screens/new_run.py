"""The New-run screen for the Fleet Manager TUI (Fleet Manager E12).

Per the design's *Launch model: viewer, not supervisor*: this screen's
entire job is to gather a workflow reference and its inputs, then hand off
to :func:`conductor.fleet.launch.launch_workflow` -- which itself delegates
to :func:`conductor.cli.bg_runner.launch_background` -- and forget. Once a
launch succeeds this screen pops back to Runs, where the new run appears on
that screen's own next poll tick; this screen never tracks the launched
run's lifecycle itself.

Two steps, both driven by explicit user action (never a poll timer, since
both can touch the network -- resolving a registry reference can fetch an
index/workflow file, and the launch itself waits on the child's dashboard
and run record):

1. Enter a workflow reference (a file path or registry ref) and resolve it
   via :func:`conductor.fleet.launch.resolve_workflow`, rendering a
   :class:`~conductor.config.schema.InputDef`-driven form (E12-T3): one
   widget per declared input (a ``Checkbox`` for ``boolean``, an ``Input``
   for the other four types), required inputs marked, defaults pre-filled,
   descriptions shown as label text.
2. Submit the form via :func:`conductor.fleet.launch.launch_workflow`, which
   validates/coerces every value against its declared type before the
   launch is attempted. Any failure -- a missing required field, a bad
   value for the declared type, or ``launch_background()`` itself failing
   (including its own D2 run-record-poll timeout) -- is rendered as text in
   this screen, never a traceback.
