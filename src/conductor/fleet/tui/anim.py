"""Animation primitives for the Fleet Manager TUI.

Everything animated in the TUI reads from a single monotonically increasing
**frame counter** rather than owning a timer of its own. One screen-level
clock ticking a counter, with each widget deriving its own appearance from
that number, keeps animations in phase with each other (every spinner in a
table turns together, which reads as one system doing one thing) and keeps
the cost to one timer no matter how many animated cells are on screen.

The functions here are **pure**: frame number in, glyph or style out. That is
what lets them be unit-tested without a running app, and what lets a screen
render a sensible *static* frame when animation is switched off -- frame 0 of
every sequence is a reasonable still image, so nothing is invisible or
half-drawn when the clock never ticks.

Animation is disabled by setting ``CONDUCTOR_FLEET_NO_ANIM`` to a non-empty
value. That exists because a TUI that repaints ten times a second is
genuinely unwelcome in some places -- over a slow SSH link, inside a
terminal multiplexer being recorded, or on battery -- and because a reader
who finds movement distracting should not have to choose between that and
the whole tool.

One of those cases is detected rather than left to the reader to notice:
:func:`is_remote_session` identifies an RDP session, and
:func:`animations_enabled` turns animation off automatically for it, with
``CONDUCTOR_FLEET_ANIM`` as the explicit force-on override. The list above
is deliberately *not* all detected -- see :func:`is_remote_session` for why
RDP is the only one that earns an automatic default.

def is_remote_session() -> str | None:
    """Detect a session whose transport makes a 10fps repaint genuinely costly.

    Modelled on :func:`conductor.fleet.tui.actions._is_wsl`'s style: stdlib
    environment sniffing only, nothing here raises, and each signal is
    trusted for a documented reason rather than guessed at.

    RDP: ``SESSIONNAME`` names the session type Windows assigned this
    logon, and every Remote Desktop session's name starts with
    ``RDP-Tcp`` (e.g. ``RDP-Tcp#0``) -- the physical console session is
    named plain ``Console`` instead, which is why the match is a prefix
    check rather than "is the variable set at all".

    **SSH is deliberately not detected here**, even though it is the case
    the module docstring above names, because the two transports are not
    comparable and measurement bore that out. RDP renders server-side into
    a framebuffer and then diffs, encodes and ships *changed pixel
    regions* with codecs tuned for mostly-static desktop content, so cost
    scales with pixels changed per second and a churning text region is
    the pathological case. SSH ships the *ANSI byte stream* and the
    client's own terminal renders it, so cost scales with bytes of changed
    text -- a few hundred per frame, fire-and-forget with no per-frame
    round trip, meaning neither bandwidth nor latency compounds. The two
    differ by orders of magnitude.

    What the module docstring actually names is a *slow* SSH link, and
    there is no signal for slow -- only for "SSH at all", which is
    overwhelmingly a fast LAN or broadband link. Disabling on that signal
    would degrade the common case, and announce a problem the reader does
    not have, to buy nothing. ``CONDUCTOR_FLEET_NO_ANIM`` remains the
    remedy for a link that genuinely is slow, and for every remote
    transport with no reliable signal at all (VNC, Citrix, xrdp).

    Returns:
        ``"RDP"`` when detected, otherwise ``None``. Typed as ``str |
        None`` rather than ``bool`` so a second transport that later earns
        an automatic default can be added without churning either this
        signature or :func:`disabled_reason`'s.
