"""``RunSummary`` derivation from a run record plus its event log.

Fleet Manager E6 (see ``docs/projects/fleet-manager/fleet-manager.design.md``,
*Implementation* → ``summary.py``): given a live :class:`~conductor.fleet.records.RunRecord`
(as returned by :func:`conductor.fleet.records.read_run_records`), derive a
:class:`RunSummary` — the status vocabulary, current step, elapsed-on-step,
token/cost totals, and any open human gate — from the run's JSONL event log,
so this can be called once per row on a ~2-second poll loop (E7's Runs
screen) without silently dropping state a long or resumed run has already
outgrown a bounded read window (issue #485).

This module used to bound its reads to a 512 KiB tail (list screen), a
512 KiB head (topology recovery for a run whose ``workflow_started`` had
aged out of that tail), and an 8 MiB cap (run-detail/step-detail screens).
Every one of those windows was sized against logs that reality then
outgrew: a run long enough to be interesting silently lost its current
step, its token/cost totals, and (on a resumed run) reported a stale
*prior* generation's terminal status. :func:`stream_event_log` replaces
all three with one **streaming, uncapped** reader — the same choice
:mod:`conductor.fleet.history`'s ``_read_full_log`` already made for the
same reason (an accepted-then-exceeded cap silently truncating live data
is worse than an unbounded read that costs proportionally more CPU).
Memory is bounded by the longest single line, not by the file's size or
event count; a 12.5 ms scan of a real 9.72 MB / 20,361-line log (with the
prefilter below) is comfortably inside the Runs screen's worker-thread
poll budget.

**Liveness is not re-derived here.** The design's own measurement found
inferring "is this run still running" from the event stream alone unreliable
(228 false positives, 0 true positives) — so this module trusts that the
``RunRecord`` it is given already passed
:func:`conductor.cli.pid.is_process_alive` (as every record from
``read_run_records()`` does) and derives only the *finer-grained* status
(``at-gate`` / ``paused`` / terminal) from explicit event markers, defaulting
to ``"running"`` when the log shows nothing more specific. A narrow race
exists where a workflow's ``workflow_completed``/``workflow_failed`` event has
been written but the process has not yet exited and removed its own record —
in that window this module correctly reports ``"completed"``/``"failed"``
even though the record is technically still live.

    """Stream-parse a JSONL event log, oldest first, yielding one parsed
    event dict at a time.

    Replaces this module's former bounded tail/head/full-log readers
    (issue #485): none of the three windows they used was actually safe
    against a run outliving it, and every one of them did, in production,
    silently and repeatedly. Memory here is bounded by the longest single
    line in the file, not by the file's size or event count -- retained
    state beyond that one line/dict is nothing. This mirrors
    :mod:`conductor.fleet.history`'s ``_read_full_log``, which made the
    same choice first, for the same reason: a byte-capped read can drop an
    early token/cost event or discard an oversized terminal event outside
    its window, silently corrupting the very state callers rely on.

    With ``keep_types``, a whitespace-tolerant anchored regex
    (:data:`_TYPE_PREFIX_RE`) reads the ``type`` key off the raw bytes and
    skips a line whose type is not in the set *without* JSON-decoding it --
    this is what keeps a per-row scan on the Runs screen's ~2s poll cheap
    even against a very large log (12.5 ms measured against a real 9.72 MB
    / 20,361-line log, versus 65 ms unfiltered). A line whose ``type`` key
    is not first (so the regex fails to match) is always parsed rather
    than skipped -- the prefilter is only ever an optimization, never a
    second opinion about what a line means, so it can never silently drop
    an event the writer happens to serialize with a different key order.

    This function is a generator: it holds the file handle open (inside
    its own ``with``) only while being consumed, and none of its side
    effects -- including ``open()`` and any ``OSError`` it raises (a
    missing file, a permission error, or any other read failure) -- happen
    until the returned iterator's first ``next()``. Unlike this module's
    former bounded readers, this does **not** swallow ``OSError``; it
    propagates, so a caller that wants the old "never raise" behavior must
    wrap the *consumption* (e.g. inside :func:`_scan_events`'s ``for``
    loop), not just the call to this function -- see :func:`derive_run_summary`.

    A malformed individual line (bad JSON, a truncated write caught
    mid-flush, invalid UTF-8) is tolerated the same way a concurrent
    in-progress write always has been here: skipped rather than aborting
    the whole read.

    Args:
        path: Path to the JSONL event log.
        keep_types: A best-effort prefilter, not an exact one: a line
            whose leading ``type`` key matches :data:`_TYPE_PREFIX_RE` and
            is not in this set is skipped without being JSON-parsed. A
            line the regex cannot read (e.g. ``type`` is not the first
            key) is always parsed and yielded regardless of this set --
            callers must still branch on ``type`` rather than assume the
            filter was exact. ``None`` parses every line.

    Yields:
        Parsed event dicts, oldest first.

    Raises:
        OSError: On the returned iterator's first ``next()`` (not at call
            time) if ``path`` cannot be opened or read -- see above.

    Accepts any one-shot iterable and makes exactly one forward pass over
    it -- no indexing, no ``len()``, no re-iteration (mirrors
    ``fleet.history._scan_history_events``'s identical issue-#436
    constraint) -- which is what lets :func:`derive_run_summary` stream
    straight from :func:`stream_event_log` instead of materializing a list.

    **Generation-aware (issue #485):** every *root* ``workflow_started``
    marks the start of a new execution generation of this run -- a resumed
    run always writes a second one into the same log, whether or not a
    dashboard was attached (see the module docstring). Reaching one resets
    the per-generation state a fresh run starts with -- ``status`` back to
    ``"running"``, any open gate cleared, every open step closed -- and
    *overwrites* (not merges) ``topology``/``workflow_name``/``cwd``/
    ``inputs`` with this generation's own, so a resumed run's current step
    and topology reflect what is actually running now, not a stale earlier
    generation. Token/cost totals are the one exception: they are **not**
    reset here, and keep accumulating across every generation in the log --
    a resumed run's lifetime usage, not just its latest attempt's.

    """Single pass over the full event stream building per-agent detail rows (E9-T3).

    Unlike :func:`_scan_events` (which only tracks aggregate totals for the
    Runs list), this tracks each agent's own completion payload
    (``elapsed``/``tokens``/``cost_usd``) individually, keyed by
    ``agent_name`` -- the per-agent history the detail screen needs that the
    list screen's aggregate totals do not carry.

    Topology (and the run's declared workflow name) extraction is folded
    into this same pass -- required once the log is read as a one-shot
    stream (issue #485): :func:`derive_run_detail` used to iterate the
    event list twice, once to find the topology and once here, which a
    one-shot iterator cannot support. The **latest** root
    ``workflow_started`` wins (last generation wins), so a resumed run's
    detail screen reflects the current generation's topology, not a stale
    earlier one. That ``workflow_started`` branch also resets ``open_steps``,
    ``gated`` and ``started_at_by_name`` -- the same resume-boundary reset
    :func:`_scan_events` does -- so a generation killed mid-step (its open
    steps and any unresolved gate never getting a closing event) cannot
    leak into how the next generation reads. Per-agent status/usage
    tracking is otherwise unchanged: an agent's cumulative tokens/cost keep
    accumulating across every restart they already did (a loop-back or a
    resume look the same to this loop -- a fresh ``agent_started`` always
    means "running now", regardless of why the process is executing it
    again), consistent with :func:`_scan_events`'s Q1
    totals-accumulate-across-generations rule.

    Args:
        events: Event dicts, oldest first (see :func:`stream_event_log`).

        (``None`` if undeclared or no such event), one :class:`AgentDetail`
        per ``topology.agents`` entry (same order, empty when ``topology``
        is ``None``), and the name of the currently open step (agent,

    not re-check liveness; see the module docstring for why. When

    summary (``status="running"``, no current step, zero totals) rather

    path is stale) never crashes the caller's poll loop -- the
    :func:`stream_event_log` generator raises on its first ``next()``, not
    at construction, so the ``try``/``except`` here wraps the *consumption*
