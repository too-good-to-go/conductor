"""Execution for ``type: mcp`` workflow steps.

An ``mcp`` step calls a tool on an MCP server configured in
``workflow.runtime.mcp_servers`` and stores the JSON-safe result envelope in
the workflow context. There is no LLM call — the step is a typed bridge
between the workflow engine and an MCP server.

Argument rendering:

- ``arguments`` values are Jinja2-rendered recursively: dicts and lists are
  walked, string leaves are rendered against the workflow context, and each
  FULLY RENDERED string is then YAML-parsed (the set-step ``auto`` rule).
  Whatever the rendered text parses as is the value: ``"105"`` -> ``int``,
  ``"true"`` -> ``bool``, ``"[1, 2]"`` -> ``list`` — including renders built
  from embedded templates, so ``"1{{ x }}"`` with ``x=2`` renders ``"12"``
  and becomes the integer ``12``, and ``"label: {{ x }}"`` becomes a mapping.
  A render that does not parse as YAML stays the raw string, and YAML-native
  scalars (int / float / bool / None) pass through untouched.
- ``FileString`` values (from the ``!file`` tag) are ``str`` subclasses and
  render like normal templates.

The result envelope (produced by
:meth:`conductor.mcp.manager.MCPManager.call_tool_structured`) has the shape
``{"content": [...], "structured": {...}|null, "is_error": bool}``. When
``structured`` is a dict, its keys are merged on top of the envelope so routes
and templates can address individual result fields directly — except the
reserved keys (see :data:`_RESERVED_ENVELOPE_KEYS`), which are never
overridden (collisions are dropped with a debug-level log, mirroring the
script-step JSON shadow precedent in ``engine/workflow.py``).
