    Both reach the provider through one ``skill_directories`` list, so a
    name claimed twice has to be resolved here. Deduplication is by skill
    **name**, not directory, because every downstream consumer is
    name-keyed — the eager preamble emits ``<skill name="...">`` per skill
    and both CLIs resolve by name, so two directories claiming one name
    would silently shadow each other.

    Precedence follows how much the author said, not which list a skill
    arrived in:

    * A skill **declared** in ``skills:`` beats a plugin's copy. Both were
      written down; the more specific statement wins. This is the common
      case — installing Conductor's plugin puts a second ``conductor``
      skill on the machine.
    * A **named plugin's** skill beats a **discovered** one. Discovery is
      ambient and varies per machine; a plugin entry was typed by the
      author. Letting a stray directory in ``~/.copilot/skills`` displace
      a component of a plugin someone asked for by name would invert the
      whole resolution-versus-discovery distinction this feature rests on.

    Only these collisions reach here — two *plugins* claiming one skill
    name is refused outright by
    :func:`~conductor.plugins.registry.resolve_plugins`, since neither
    entry is more authoritative than the other.

    Args:
        declared: The agent's effective skills — entries from ``skills:``
            / ``runtime.skills`` **plus** anything ``skill_discovery``
            turned up. ``ResolvedSkill.discovered`` distinguishes them.
        from_plugins: Skills contributed by enabled plugins.
        on_warning: Sink for the shadowing notice. Reported rather than
            logged, because Conductor installs no logging handlers, so a
            dropped skill would otherwise be invisible.
