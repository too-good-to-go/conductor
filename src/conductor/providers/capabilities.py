"""Provider capability descriptors and validator/runtime cross-check primitives.

Every :class:`~conductor.providers.base.AgentProvider` subclass declares a
class-level :class:`ProviderCapabilities` descriptor so that ``conductor
validate`` can statically cross-check workflow features against what the
provider actually supports. See issue #241 for design rationale.

The schema is intentionally **declarative and provider-agnostic** — no
top-level imports of provider SDK modules or heavy engine modules here, so
it can be referenced from anywhere without risking circular imports at
module load time. The one exception is :data:`ReasoningEffortLevel`, which
re-exports :data:`conductor.providers.reasoning.ReasoningEffort` as the
single source of truth for the reasoning-effort vocabulary (#299) —
``reasoning`` is a narrow leaf module (it depends only on
``conductor.templating``) so importing it here introduces no cycle. The
lazy :func:`get_capabilities` resolver performs deferred ``importlib``
imports of provider modules so callers don't need to instantiate providers
(i.e. no API keys required for ``validate``).
