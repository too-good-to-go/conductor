    discovered through the plugin that owns it. Each directory is therefore
    resolved back to its Claude Code plugin root, which is registered via
    ``plugins`` (``--plugin-dir``) and referenced by the plugin-qualified
    ``<plugin>:<skill>`` name.

    Args:
        skill_directories: Absolute skill directory paths from
            :class:`~conductor.executor.agent.AgentExecutor`, or ``None``
            when no skills are enabled.

    Returns:
        A ``(skill_names, plugin_configs)`` tuple. The lists are not
        index-parallel: two skills shipped by one plugin produce two names
        and a single plugin registration. Both are empty when no skills are
        enabled — and an empty ``skills`` list is meaningful to the SDK: it
        suppresses every skill rather than falling back to CLI discovery
        defaults.

    Raises:
        ProviderError: If a skill cannot be turned into a name the CLI will
            resolve — it lives under no plugin root, its plugin manifest is
            unusable, or two plugins claim the same qualified name. Each of
            those would otherwise hand the agent less than the workflow
            declared, silently.

        """Resolve the SDK ``tools`` and ``permission_mode`` for an agent.

        Conductor's ``tools:`` allowlist contains workflow-tool names that
        resolve through ``runtime.tools`` — they are NOT Claude CLI tool
        identifiers. We therefore refuse to forward a non-empty allowlist
        to the SDK rather than silently grant the wrong native tools.

        The ``tools`` argument is the executor's *resolved* list from
        :func:`conductor.executor.agent.resolve_agent_tools`. That function
        erases the distinction between an omitted ``tools:`` and an explicit
        ``tools: []``: both arrive here as an empty list whenever the
        workflow declares no workflow-level ``tools:`` (``config.tools`` is
        empty; a non-empty list makes an omitted agent resolve non-empty). We
        therefore consult the RAW ``agent.tools`` field — the only place the
        omitted-vs-explicit signal survives — to pick the default.

        Semantics:

        * ``tools`` empty (``[]`` or ``None``) and ``agent.tools is None`` —
          the agent omitted ``tools:``. Fall back to the ``claude_code``
          preset (filesystem, bash, web) and bypass permissions, matching
          what the user gets from the bare ``claude`` CLI.
        * ``tools`` empty and ``agent.tools == []`` — explicit "no tools"
          request. Pass an empty list to the SDK so all tools are disabled.
          Drop the permission bypass because there are no tools to permit.
          When skills are enabled, grant the ``Skill`` tool back: an empty
          base tool set would otherwise leave the declared skill unreachable,
          silently ignoring the ``skills:`` the workflow asked for.
        * ``tools`` non-empty — honored. MCP entries are forwarded as
          ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` in ``allowed_tools`` and the enumerated
          complement is denied; natively named entries become the SDK ``tools``
          list, so every other built-in is removed by omission rather than by
          an always-incomplete deny-list.

        Args:
            tools: The executor-resolved ``tools:`` allowlist for this agent.
            agent: The agent definition. ``agent.tools`` carries the raw
                omitted-vs-explicit-empty signal; ``agent.name`` is used in
                the error message.
            skills_enabled: Whether this agent can reach a skill by any
                route — resolved by Conductor (``skills:``/``plugins:``/
                discovery) *or* discovered by the CLI itself from a non-empty
                ``setting_sources``. Adds the ``Skill`` tool: to an explicit
                ``tools: []`` as its one carve-out, and to a non-empty
                allowlist alongside the tools the agent declared. Without it
                a listed skill is unusable — visible to the model with no
                tool to invoke it.
            enumerated_mcp_tools: Every ``<server>__<tool>`` the declared servers
                expose, used to compute the complement to deny.

        Returns:
            A ``(sdk_tools, permission_mode, allowed_tools, disallowed_tools)``
            tuple suitable for ``ClaudeAgentOptions``. The last two are empty
            unless the agent declares a non-empty allowlist.
