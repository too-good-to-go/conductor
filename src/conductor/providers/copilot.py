            retry_config: Optional retry configuration. Uses default if not provided.
            model: Default model to use if not specified in agent. Defaults to "gpt-4o".
            mcp_servers: MCP server configurations to pass to the SDK.
                Note: The Copilot CLI has a bug where 'env' vars in MCP server
                configs are not passed to MCP server subprocesses.
                See: https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk/issues/163
            idle_recovery_config: Optional idle detection and recovery configuration.
                                  Uses default if not provided.
            temperature: Default temperature for generation (0.0-1.0). Optional.
            max_agent_iterations: Maximum tool-use iterations per agent execution.
                None means no iteration limit (only wall-clock timeout applies).
            default_reasoning_effort: Workflow-wide default ``reasoning_effort``
                applied to ``create_session`` when an agent does not specify
                its own ``reasoning.effort``. One of ``low``, ``medium``,
                ``high``, ``xhigh``, ``max``, or ``None`` to send no value.
            default_context_tier: Workflow-wide default ``context_tier`` applied
                to ``create_session`` when an agent does not specify its own
                ``context_tier``. One of ``default``, ``long_context``, or
                ``None`` to send no value.
            provider_settings: Optional structured provider settings from
                ``runtime.provider``. When ``has_custom_routing()`` is True,
                the resolved SDK ``ProviderConfig`` is attached to every
                ``create_session`` call (both agent execution and dialog
                turns), enabling custom OpenAI-compatible / Azure / Anthropic
                endpoints. ``runtime_url`` instead selects an existing Copilot
                CLI process and can be combined with that routing. Env-var fallbacks
                (``COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`` → ``OPENAI_BASE_URL``,

                activate custom routing on their own.
            tool_output: MCP tool result output-size configuration. Defines the
                per-result character limit and spill-to-file behavior for MCP
                tool outputs. ``None`` means the default configuration is used.
            github_token: GitHub token used to authenticate each session with
                the Copilot SDK in memory, via the ``github_token`` parameter
                on ``create_session`` / ``resume_session`` (the SDK's
                ``gitHubToken`` connect payload sent over the RPC channel),
                so the runtime uses GitHub Copilot's own model routing
                (Copilot capacity) rather than a custom endpoint. This is
                deliberately *not* passed to the ``CopilotClient`` constructor:
                the SDK forwards a constructor-level ``github_token`` to the
                spawned runtime as a ``COPILOT_SDK_AUTH_TOKEN`` environment
                variable, which is not the in-memory delivery this provider
                requires. Applied to every session-creation call site (main
                agent execution, resume, and dialog turns) except when
                connecting to an existing runtime via ``runtime_url`` — that
                path authenticates via the external runtime's own connection
                instead. ``None`` preserves the existing default behavior
                (the SDK's own credential resolution, e.g. a logged-in

        When enabled, the value is forwarded to the SDK as-is. The Copilot SDK
        expects ``max_size_bytes``; Conductor forwards ``ToolOutputConfig.max_chars``
        as bytes on a 1:1 basis by design. This means multibyte UTF-8 characters
        (CJK, emoji, etc.) will be cut off by the SDK earlier than
        ``max_chars`` characters of text. Conductor intentionally does not perform
        its own truncation for Copilot because the SDK owns the tool loop.

        The SDK has no "truncate in-place without spilling" mode. Therefore
        ``spill_to_file=False`` is mapped to ``{"enabled": False}``, which
        disables large-output handling entirely for the session — unlike the
        Claude provider, where the same setting still truncates to
        ``max_chars`` and only skips the file write.

        ``output_directory`` is only included when ``spill_dir`` is explicitly
        configured; otherwise the SDK uses its own OS-level temporary
        directory.

        implicit fallback for ``api_key`` — that would silently send an
        OpenAI credential to whatever ``base_url`` points at, which is

        Studio) are the dominant use case.

        When both ``api_key`` and ``bearer_token`` resolve (from any
        combination of YAML and env vars), both are forwarded; the
        Copilot SDK silently prefers ``bearer_token`` and a warning is
        emitted.

        Raises ``ProviderError`` when custom routing is activated but
        every routing field resolves to a falsy value (e.g. all
