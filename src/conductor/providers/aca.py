"""Azure Container Apps (ACA) dynamic-sessions runtime provider.

This module provides ``AcaRuntimeProvider`` — a thin host-side transport
shim implementing :class:`~conductor.providers.base.AgentProvider` that
delegates agent execution to an in-sandbox ``conductor-agent-runner``
process running inside an Azure Container Apps dynamic-sessions pool.

The library is an optional dependency. ``conductor run`` and ``conductor
doctor`` print the install command for the detected install context (see
:mod:`conductor.install_hint`); a hardcoded ``pip install`` string cannot
work on the documented install path, where a uv tool venv is not
pip-managed and ``conductor-cli`` is not on PyPI (issue #441). Note the
provider is constructed lazily, so this surfaces when the first agent on
it runs — not at ``conductor validate``.
The extra pins ``azure-identity`` plus ``azure-core[aio]`` — the latter
supplies the ``aiohttp``-based async transport the async
``DefaultAzureCredential`` in this module requires; ``azure-identity``
alone does not include one.

The transport shim (epic E3, issue #284) derives a session ``identifier``
from ``identifier_scope`` (DD5), acquires a cached AAD bearer token, issues a
single streaming ``POST {pool_endpoint}/execute`` request (Branch S, DD3),
relays the runner's NDJSON event frames verbatim to ``event_callback``, and
parses the terminal ``result`` frame into :class:`AgentOutput`. The
in-sandbox ``conductor-agent-runner`` itself (epic E4) is not yet built —
this module implements only the host side of the contract defined in
:mod:`conductor.providers.aca_protocol`.

    OAuth token as a supported Copilot credential source (``copilot login
    --help`` lists "OAuth tokens from the GitHub CLI (gh) app"), and most
    operators are already signed in.

    Every failure mode means the same thing — "no token from this source" —

    on a non-executable ``gh`` on ``PATH``). The token is returned as a
    ``SecretStr`` and is never logged — only *which source won* is logged.

    Caveats worth knowing (documented, not enforced here): ``gh`` tokens are
    user OAuth tokens subject to SAML SSO authorization and org OAuth-app

        Implements the Data Flow formula
        ``cond-{run_salt}-{scope_key}{concurrency_suffix}``: ``scope_key``
        comes from the effective ``identifier_scope`` (per-agent
        ``sandbox.identifier_scope`` override, else the workflow-wide
        default), and the concurrency discriminator is appended whenever a
        for-each loop signal (``_key`` when ``key_by`` is set, else
        ``_index``) is present in ``context``.

        This is the *reuse* key described by the Data Flow table — calling
        it twice for the same agent/context always returns the same string,
        which is what makes sequential re-executions (loop-backs, retries,
        sequential ``for_each`` iterations of a different agent under
        ``identifier_scope: workflow``) share one sandbox workspace.

        **OQ#1 decision.** The design's *Data Flow* mandates a discriminator
        for "any concurrent unit", but this function's only per-call signal
        is ``context`` — the for-each loop key, when present. A ``parallel``
        group carries no such signal at all, and scopes other than the
        default ``agent``/``item`` don't already vary ``scope_key`` by agent
        name, so relying on this function alone is not sufficient to keep
        concurrent siblings from colliding (e.g. two members of a `parallel`
        group under `identifier_scope: workflow` would otherwise resolve to
        the *same* logical identifier). Rather than change the `execute()`
        contract (ruled out by this epic's acceptance criteria),
        `execute()` layers a runtime in-flight registry on top of this
        logical identifier (`_acquire_wire_identifier`/
        `_release_wire_identifier`): it only diverges the identifier
        actually sent over the wire when another call sharing this same
        logical identifier is genuinely in flight *right now*, and reuses it
        otherwise — satisfying both halves of the Data Flow contract
        (sequential reuse, concurrent divergence) with no engine-visible
        change.

        The result is charset-normalized (lowercase alphanumeric + hyphen)
        and truncated to ``_MAX_IDENTIFIER_LENGTH`` chars with an
        unconditional hash suffix so two distinct raw identifiers never
        collide after normalization/truncation.

        Precedence (DD4): ``COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`` → ``GH_TOKEN`` →
        ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` → ``gh auth token`` — first non-empty
        (post-``strip()``) wins, via ``_clean_env`` (review fix: a
        whitespace-only value no longer counts as "set", which would

        Copilot CLI's *own* documented credential chain (env vars, then its
        stored OAuth token, then a ``gh`` CLI fallback), so an operator
        already signed in with ``gh`` needs no ACA-specific setup at all.

        The ``gh`` fallback exists because the sandbox's inner Copilot
        session cannot perform interactive OAuth inside a headless
        container, so *something* host-side has to produce a token; reusing
        the one the operator already has beats requiring a hand-created PAT
        for every run. Deliberately **not** implemented: reading the Copilot
        editor plugins' credential store (``~/.config/github-copilot/auth.db``).
        That store belongs to the Copilot Language Server rather than the
        CLI/SDK this provider drives, has changed format twice, and is
        slated to be encrypted at rest — see
        ``docs/projects/aca/aca-provider.design.md`` (DD4).

        Wrapping in ``SecretStr`` immediately on read keeps the value
        redacted in any incidental repr/str of the resolved credential;
        callers must explicitly call ``get_secret_value()`` to obtain the
        plaintext, mirroring the ``ProviderSettings.api_key`` /

        ``bearer_token``/``api_key``/``base_url`` (those stay copilot-only,
        ``_check_field_compatibility``), so this reads environment variables
        directly and forwards them so the runner can construct

        for its inner ``CopilotProvider`` instead of attempting an
        impossible interactive OAuth flow inside a headless sandbox.

        Precedence mirrors the Copilot CLI's own auth resolution — no
        ``credential_mode`` switch:

        1. ``COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`` set (non-whitespace, via
           ``_clean_env``) → forward BYOK custom-routing settings unchanged
           (``base_url`` + optional ``COPILOT_PROVIDER_API_KEY`` /
           ``COPILOT_PROVIDER_BEARER_TOKEN``) — the same env vars the
           Copilot custom-routing resolver reads
           (``copilot.py:_resolve_sdk_provider_config``). ``base_url`` wins
           even when a GitHub token is also present.
        2. Otherwise, source a GitHub token (`_resolve_github_token`) — env
           vars first, then a best-effort ``gh auth token`` — and forward it
           as ``github_token`` so the runner's inner ``CopilotProvider``
           authenticates against GitHub Copilot's own model routing — the
           operator's Copilot capacity.
        3. Neither resolves → fail loudly rather than run the sandbox
           unauthenticated or silently degraded.

        Acceptable only for **trusted use** (DD4) — the plaintext credential
        travels in the request body to the runner.

        Review fix: every secret value (``api_key``/``bearer_token``/
        ``github_token``) is stored as a ``SecretStr`` instance in the
        returned dict, not the plaintext ``str``. ``AcaExecuteRequest``'s
        ``inner_provider_settings`` field is ``dict[str, Any]``, so pydantic
        still recognizes and redacts these values (``"**********"``) in
        ``model_dump``/``repr``/logging — only the dedicated wire-serialization
        step in :meth:`execute` (``_wire_body``) unwraps them to plaintext,
        right before the request bytes leave the process. A second
        review fix — ``AcaExecuteRequest._redact_inner_provider_secrets`` —
        additionally enforces this ``SecretStr`` wrapping for any
        construction path that does *not* go through this method (e.g. a
        raw dict/JSON payload passed to ``model_validate``), so redaction
        does not depend solely on every caller using this helper.

        rejecting anything else (e.g. ``runtime_url``, ``headers``) with a
        400. A future key added to this method's returned dict must be

        Issue #396: `/health` reports two runner-side facts —
        `auth_required` (whether `ACA_RUNNER_AUTH_TOKEN` is configured
        there) and `auth_token_present` (whether *a* token header arrived on
        this very request — never whether it matched). Comparing those

        distinct real misconfigurations, in either direction:

        - The runner requires a token but none arrived: the header did not
          survive the trip (e.g. a gateway stripping custom headers), so
          every `/execute` call will fail with a 401.
        - The host has a token configured but the runner reports no gate:
          `ACA_RUNNER_AUTH_TOKEN` isn't set there, so the header is being
