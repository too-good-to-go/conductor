        this order:

        **workflow ``cost.pricing`` override → this hook → ``DEFAULT_PRICING`` →

        A provider that knows its own rates (e.g. the Copilot SDK exposes
        per-model billing metadata) should return a
        :class:`~conductor.engine.pricing.ModelPricing` so cost reporting stays
        current without waiting for the static table to be refreshed on every
        model release. Providers whose SDK exposes no pricing (e.g. the
        Anthropic API's ``models.list()``) should return ``None`` and let the
        static table handle it — which is exactly what this default does.

        Implementations must:

        * Return ``None`` when the model is unknown to the provider, when the
          SDK exposes no usable pricing, or when the SDK call fails.
