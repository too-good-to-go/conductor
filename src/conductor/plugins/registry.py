"""Resolve ``plugins:`` entries to on-disk plugins and their components.

An entry is either an **installed plugin name** or a **filesystem path**,
classified syntactically by
:func:`~conductor.skills.registry.is_path_entry` — the same rule
``skills:`` uses, so a bare name is never shadowed by a same-named local
directory and classification never depends on what happens to exist.

Resolving a name reads the same installed-plugin roots that skill
discovery used to scan, but the two are opposites and the distinction is
the point of issue #378. Discovery is *ambient*: whatever is installed
enters the run, and a missing plugin is silently less capability.
Resolution is *named*: the author wrote it down, nothing enters unasked,
and a missing plugin is a hard error at ``conductor validate``.

Each resolved plugin is split into the components Conductor can register
individually — skills, subagents, MCP servers — so the per-component
tri-state on ``plugins:`` means something. See :mod:`conductor.plugins`
for why handing the SDK a plugin root instead would not.
