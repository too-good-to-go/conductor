"""Read git-backed marketplaces the Copilot CLI itself registered.

``~/.copilot/settings.json`` is the CLI's own record of
``extraKnownMarketplaces`` — directories a user pointed the Copilot CLI
at, outside anything Conductor knows about. On an ordinary developer
machine this is where most installed plugins actually come from: the
directory is registered here, and ``~/.copilot/installed-plugins/`` (the
location :mod:`conductor.plugins.registry` otherwise searches) is empty.
Reading it is what makes a ``plugin@marketplace`` reference that already
works for the Copilot CLI also work for a ``provider: copilot`` agent,
with no ``runtime.plugin_sources`` entry required.

This is deliberately scoped to the ``copilot`` flavor only — see its one
call site in :mod:`conductor.plugins.registry` — since the file is
Copilot's own registry and a Claude-flavored agent has no business
resolving against it.

Only the ``"directory"`` source kind is read. A marketplace registered
some other way (a git remote the CLI itself clones) names a place
Conductor cannot read without acquiring it exactly the way
``plugin_sources:`` does, so it is skipped rather than guessed at.

``enabledPlugins`` is deliberately not read. Plugins stay named-only
resolution, never discovery — the same reasoning
:mod:`conductor.plugins.registry`'s module docstring gives for why an
installed plugin is not ambiently enabled.

Kept as a leaf module (stdlib + :mod:`conductor.plugins.errors` only,
though it currently needs neither) so it can be imported freely from
:mod:`conductor.plugins.registry` without adding any new edge to the
package's layering.

    isolation ``home`` exists to provide, and makes the same settings
    file expand to two different directories on two platforms whenever
    the two variables disagree.

    so it is expanded against it directly. In production the two are
    identical, since the caller passes the real home.
