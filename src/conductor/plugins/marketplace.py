"""Read a marketplace *catalog* and locate the plugins it lists.

A git source is one of two shapes, and both exist in the wild:

* a **catalog** — a repository holding many plugins, with a
  ``marketplace.json`` naming each one and where it lives;
* a **single plugin** — a repository that *is* one plugin, with a
  ``plugin.json`` at its root.

Detection is automatic, with an explicit ``plugin:`` key to settle the
case where a repository is both.

Two catalog conventions are recognised, matching the two plugin-manifest
conventions in :mod:`conductor.plugins.manifest`. They are not
interchangeable, and the difference is not cosmetic — verified against a
real marketplace repository that ships both:

======================================  =============  =====================
Manifest                                ``pluginRoot`` per-plugin ``source``
======================================  =============  =====================
``.claude-plugin/marketplace.json``     ``./dist/claude``  ``./dist/claude/ado``
``.github/plugin/marketplace.json``     ``./dist/copilot`` ``./ado``
======================================  =============  =====================

The first anchors ``source`` at the repository root; the second anchors it
at ``pluginRoot``. Assuming either one strands every plugin published
under the other, so both anchors are tried and whichever holds a plugin
manifest wins.
