"""Background runner for ``--web-bg`` mode.

When ``conductor run --web-bg`` or ``conductor resume --web-bg`` is used, this
module forks a detached child process that runs the workflow with ``--web``
enabled, then the parent process prints the dashboard URL and exits
immediately.

The child process is fully detached (new session on Unix, new process group on
Windows) so it outlives the parent. It auto-shuts down after the workflow
completes and all WebSocket clients disconnect (the existing ``--web`` +
``bg=True`` behavior in ``WebDashboard``).

The child's stdout and stderr are redirected into log files under
``$TMPDIR/conductor/`` (not ``DEVNULL``) so a silent crash — an uncaught
Python exception, a ``faulthandler`` dump, or anything else the child
would normally write to ``sys.stderr`` — leaves a forensic trail. See
issue #116 for context.

This is also why we deliberately do NOT pass ``--silent`` to the child
even though no human is watching its console: ``--silent`` would also
set ``verbose_mode=False``, which gates provider-side SDK event logging
that ``--log-file`` writes to disk. Leaving verbosity at the default and
capturing the stream to a file keeps both the log files and any
``--log-file`` trace populated for detached children (see issue #196).

**Three-stage readiness contract** (issues #410, #435, #444): a bg launch
is considered "finalized" only after three separate probes, not one.
Stage one (:func:`_wait_for_server`) is a plain TCP connect — it proves a
process is listening on the port, nothing more. Stage one-and-a-half
polls the child's own fleet run record (:mod:`conductor.fleet.records`)
until it appears matching this launch's ``mode``/``port`` and either its
``pid`` equals the spawned :class:`subprocess.Popen`'s pid *or* it is
*fresh* — written at or after the moment this launcher spawned the child
(see :func:`_record_is_fresh`). The freshness arm exists because
``Popen.pid`` is **not** always the pid of the process that ends up
running the workflow: on some platforms (notably a Windows ``uv tool
install``) ``sys.executable`` is a trampoline that re-execs, so the
process this module spawns and the process that actually serves the
dashboard are related but distinct pids. Comparing ``Popen.pid`` against
that fact is a false negative, not a safety check — see issue #444. If
the poll's own deadline passes while the child stays alive and its
dashboard stays reachable, this is downgraded to a warning
(``run_record_written=False`` on the returned :class:`BackgroundLaunch`)
rather than treated as a launch failure, since a bookkeeping failure must
not kill an otherwise healthy workflow. Once the record matches, the
launcher carries the record's ``pid`` forward as the *confirmed* identity
of the process actually running the workflow — this is what stage two
compares against instead of ``Popen.pid``. Stage two
(:func:`_wait_for_workflow_start`) polls ``GET /api/info`` until the
payload carries a ``started_at`` key, which only appears once the
child's engine has actually emitted ``workflow_started`` — proving the
workflow itself began rather than just the dashboard's HTTP server. It
also classifies the dashboard's reported identity against the confirmed
pid (falling back to ``run_id`` only when the payload itself has no
usable pid to compare, mirroring ``cli/app.py::_confirm_identity``/
``Identity``); a mismatch is only fatal
(``StartProbe.PORT_CONFLICT``) when the identity was confirmed -- an
*unconfirmed* mismatch keeps polling rather than killing a possibly
healthy run on unproven suspicion. All three stages check ``proc.poll()``
on every iteration so a child that exits early (e.g. a
``ConfigurationError`` from a bad workflow) is reported in about a
second instead of after the full timeout. The stage-two wait defaults to
30s and is tunable via ``CONDUCTOR_WEB_BG_START_TIMEOUT`` (``0`` disables
it, restoring pre-#410 behavior); passing that deadline with the child
still alive is not treated as a failure — the URL is still printed,
since the workflow may simply be slow to start (plugin fetch, MCP server
startup, provider connection). There is no parent-side PID file: the
child writes its own fleet run record (Fleet Manager D2), which is what
stage one-and-a-half polls for.

**Terminating the process tree, not just ``Popen.pid`` (issue #447):**
every failure branch of the readiness gate above eventually needs to
clean up a still-running child, and doing that by calling ``terminate()``
on the spawned :class:`subprocess.Popen` handle alone is unsound under a
trampoline ``sys.executable`` (issue #444's Q1) -- the pid that ends up
running the workflow is not always the pid this module spawned, so
terminating only the latter can leave the former orphaned and still
burning tokens. :func:`_terminate_child` therefore kills the whole
*process tree* before falling back to the single-handle ladder: on
Windows, the child is created suspended and immediately assigned to a
fresh job object (see :func:`_spawn_detached_windows`,
:class:`_WindowsDetachedProcess`) with ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK``
set but **not** ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` (the job must
survive the launcher exiting -- that's the entire point of
``--web-bg``), so ``TerminateJobObject`` reaches every process the child
spawned, however many exec layers deep; on POSIX,
``start_new_session=True`` already makes the child a process-group
leader, so ``os.killpg`` is the equivalent, gated by a registry
(:data:`_SPAWNED_GROUP_LEADERS`) of pids this module actually spawned so
it is never called against an arbitrary pid. After the tree kill and the
single-handle ladder, a final identity-checked sweep
(``conductor.cli.pid.is_process_alive``/``terminate_process``) confirms
the outcome rather than assuming it, naming any pid that survives in a
:class:`_TerminationOutcome` instead of unconditionally claiming success.
:func:`_cleanup_record_after_termination` only removes a child's run
record once its pid is confirmed dead by that sweep, so a surviving
orphan keeps the run record that is ``conductor stop``'s only remaining
handle on it.

class BackgroundLaunch:
    """Result of launching a ``--web-bg`` child process.

    Attributes:
        url: The dashboard URL (e.g. ``http://127.0.0.1:8080``).
        stderr_log: Path to the file capturing the child's stderr — the
            first place to look when a bg run misbehaves silently.
        stdout_log: Path to the file capturing the child's stdout.
        run_id: The run id that ties this bg launch to its ``.events.jsonl``
            peer via ``CONDUCTOR_RUN_ID``. Normally exactly 8 lowercase hex
            characters (a fresh ``conductor.run_id.new_run_id()``), but a
            resumed launch may force-carry a checkpoint's original run id
            instead (see ``_peek_resume_run_id``), which is validated
            against the same path-safe contract the fleet run-record store
            itself uses.
        workflow_started: Whether the launcher observed the workflow actually
            start (via ``GET /api/info`` reporting a ``workflow_started``
            event — see ``_wait_for_workflow_start``) before its wait
            deadline. ``True`` means only that the launcher did **not**
            observe a failure to start — it is the default because the
            stage-two probe can be disabled entirely via
            ``CONDUCTOR_WEB_BG_START_TIMEOUT=0``, in which case nothing
            contradicts it. ``False`` means the deadline passed with the
            child still alive but not yet reporting a start; callers should
            surface this as a "still initializing" note rather than a
            failure — see issue #410. Only meaningful once ``still_running``
            has already been checked (see below) — check ``still_running``
            first.
        still_running: Whether the child process was still alive when the
            launcher finished waiting. ``True`` in the common case (the
            workflow is a genuine long-running background run). ``False``
            when the child completed (exit code 0) inside the launcher's
            wait window — either before the port opened or during the
            stage-two workflow-start probe. This is deliberately a separate
            field from ``workflow_started``: a clean sub-second run makes
            ``workflow_started`` stay ``True`` while ``still_running``
            becomes ``False`` — the two fields deliberately diverge in
            exactly this case, rather than both reading ``True``, because
            callers must not report a URL/"running in background" for a
            process that has already exited (issue #410) — printing that
            message unconditionally on ``workflow_started`` alone would
            reintroduce a narrower form of the same false-success bug this
            PR fixes. Check this field *before* ``workflow_started``: the
            latter is only meaningful when this one is ``True``.
        run_record_written: Whether the child's fleet run record was
            actually observed by the launch gate (see
            ``_finalize_background_launch``). ``True`` in the overwhelming
            common case. ``False`` means the run is executing normally —
            the dashboard came up and stayed reachable — but the discovery
            record itself could not be confirmed within the poll window,
            so this run will **not** appear in ``conductor status`` /
            ``fleet list`` / the ``fleet`` TUI and cannot be stopped with
            ``conductor stop`` (issue #435: a bookkeeping failure must not
            be treated as a launch failure and kill an otherwise-healthy
            workflow). Callers should surface this with a warning pointing
            at the captured stderr log, where the child's own
            ``_write_run_record_for_current_process`` failure handler
            names the underlying cause.

    Invariants (enforced in ``__post_init__``):
        * ``run_id`` is a valid fleet run id -- see
          ``conductor.run_id.is_valid_run_id``, the same contract
          the child's own ``write_run_record`` call enforces.
        * ``url`` is a localhost URL (``http://127.0.0.1:<port>``).
        * ``run_id`` appears in both ``stderr_log.name`` and
          ``stdout_log.name`` — this is what lets the bg log files and
          the child's ``.events.jsonl`` correlate by filename. See

    1. Tree kill: ``terminate_tree()`` (Windows job object) when *proc*
       is a :class:`_WindowsDetachedProcess`, else ``os.killpg(proc.pid,

       Runs unconditionally, regardless of ``proc.poll()``: a Windows job
       object and a POSIX process group both outlive their initial
       process, and this is precisely the ``StartProbe.CHILD_EXITED`` case
       issue #447 exists for -- the outer trampoline shim has already
       exited while the re-exec'd workflow it started lives on.
    2. The original polite/forceful ladder on *proc* itself
       (``terminate()`` → wait 5s → ``kill()`` → wait 2s), skipped when
       ``proc.poll()`` already shows *proc* dead.
    3. A final, identity-checked sweep over every pid this call knows
       about (``proc.pid`` and, if different, *confirmed_child_pid*) via
       ``conductor.cli.pid``'s ``is_process_alive``/``terminate_process``.

       it: a tree kill or the ladder above can each fail silently (a
       permission error, a race, a trampoline child that escaped a job
       the launcher couldn't create).

    Rung 3 runs even when *proc* already looks dead, because under a
    trampoline ``sys.executable`` the outer *proc* exiting says nothing
    about whether *confirmed_child_pid* -- the pid actually running the
    workflow -- is still alive.

    """Wait for the dashboard, wait for the child's run record, then confirm it started.

    On a fatal failure (server didn't start, child died early, the port is
    taken by a foreign process), the still-running child is terminated to
    avoid orphaned processes holding the dashboard port. The stderr log path
    (with a bounded tail of its contents) is included in the
    ``RuntimeError`` so callers can point users at the captured crash
    output.

    The run-record poll (stage one-and-a-half, below) is a *readiness
    signal*, not a kill switch (issue #435): if its own deadline passes
    while the child is confirmed alive and still serving its port, that
    means the child's discovery bookkeeping failed, not that the workflow
    itself is unhealthy -- terminating a working run over a failed
    diagnostic write would be strictly worse than leaving it running
    undiscoverable. Only a child that is actually dead, or that has gone
    unreachable, fails the launch at this stage.

    Per D2 (the child owns the write in every mode — see
    ``docs/projects/fleet-manager/fleet-manager.design.md``), the detached
    child is responsible for writing its own fleet run record (keyed by
    ``run_id``) once it starts executing. This function is the parent-side
    gate: it polls :func:`conductor.fleet.records.read_run_record` rather
    than writing a PID/record file itself, so there is exactly one writer
    (and hence exactly one record) per background run. This replaces the
    parent-side ``write_pid_file`` the two-stage contract originally wrote
    here; the run record supersedes the PID file and is written by the
    child, so re-introducing a parent-side write would create a second
    writer for one run.

    The polled record must match this launch on three fields before the
    gate accepts it as readiness (see :func:`_confirmed_pid_from_record`)
    -- a record merely found under the right ``run_id`` is not proof by
    itself that *this* launch's child is up:

    * ``mode`` must be ``"bg"`` (rules out a record some other, differently
      launched process happens to have written under a colliding key).
    * ``port`` must equal ``web_port`` (rules out advertising an unrelated
      service's record when the requested port was occupied and the child
      fell back to a different, or no, port).
    * identity: either ``pid`` equals the spawned child's ``proc.pid``, or
      the record is *fresh* -- written at or after ``launched_at`` (issue
      #444). The pid check alone rules out a stale record left behind
      under the same key (e.g., in the forced-resume-run-id case, a
      leftover record from the *original*, now-dead run that the resumed
      child hasn't yet overwritten), but ``proc.pid`` is not always the
      pid of the process that ends up running the workflow: under a
      trampoline ``sys.executable`` (a Windows ``uv tool install``, the
      documented install path) the spawned process re-execs into a
      different one, so the two pids legitimately differ even on a
      perfectly healthy launch. A record written after we spawned this
      launch's child cannot be that stale leftover, so freshness is
      accepted as an alternative rather than a replacement -- the
      non-trampoline path, and every test built around plain pid
      equality, is unaffected.

    A failure while reading the record itself (as opposed to the record
    simply not existing yet, which :func:`conductor.fleet.records.read_run_record`
    already reports as ``None``) also terminates the child and raises,
    rather than letting the exception escape uncontained and orphan the
    background process.

    Because the child writes its record as it starts executing, seeing a
    matching record is a *stronger* readiness signal than the PID write it
    replaces -- but it is still not proof the engine reached
    ``workflow_started``, so the stage-two ``/api/info`` probe (issue #410)
    is retained below. Once a record is confirmed, its ``pid`` -- not
    ``proc.pid`` -- becomes the *trusted* identity passed to stage two,
    since it is the pid of the process actually running the workflow.

    Args:
        proc: The detached child process.
        web_port: The TCP port the child should be listening on.
        run_id: The run id shared with the child via ``CONDUCTOR_RUN_ID``,
            used to look up its run record once written.
        stderr_log: Path to the file capturing the child's stderr. Included
            in failure messages so users know where to look.
        launched_at: Timestamp captured immediately before ``proc`` was
            spawned (see ``_spawn_bg_child``), used by
            :func:`_confirmed_pid_from_record` to decide whether a polled
            record is fresh enough to trust despite a pid mismatch.

    Returns:
        A :class:`_GateOutcome`. ``workflow_started`` is ``True`` if the
        workflow was observed to start (or the stage-two probe is
        disabled, or the child exited cleanly within the wait window),
        ``False`` if the stage-two wait deadline passed with the child
        still alive and not yet reporting a start (not a failure, just
        "still initializing"). ``run_record_written`` is ``False`` only
        when the run-record poll's own deadline passed while the child was
        confirmed alive and reachable (issue #435).

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If the child died early (with a non-zero exit code),
            the dashboard didn't start within the timeout, reading the run
            record itself failed, the run-record poll deadline passed

    whenever the checkpoint's ``event_log_path`` still points at a real
    file — see ``EventLogSubscriber.__init__``'s
    ``existing_path``/``existing_run_id`` branch. The parent must mirror
    that exact same decision so ``_finalize_background_launch`` polls
    ``read_run_record`` for the id the child will actually write under
    (D2); polling a freshly generated id here would time out and
    terminate a perfectly healthy resumed run whenever the original log
    file survived.

    This function and ``EventLogSubscriber``'s ``existing_run_id`` branch
    both defer to the single shared rule in :mod:`conductor.run_id`
    (issue #435) -- before that, this module kept its own broad
    (path-safe) copy while ``EventLogSubscriber``'s *other* branch (the
    ``CONDUCTOR_RUN_ID`` env-var fallback taken when the peeked log has
    vanished between this peek and child start) enforced a narrower
    hex-only rule and lowercased the result, so a checkpoint id this
    function accepted here could still be rejected (and folded to a
    different value) by the child, silently polling for a key the child
    never wrote. With one shared rule, that divergence cannot recur.

    Best-effort: any failure to locate or parse the checkpoint returns
    ``None`` (falling back to a freshly generated id, the pre-existing
    behavior) rather than raising — the child's own checkpoint resolution
    is authoritative and reports a real error if something is actually
